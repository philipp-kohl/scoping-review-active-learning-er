However, annotators are often unreliable and current aggregation methods cannot capture common types of span annotation errors. To address this, we propose a Bayesian method for aggregating sequence tags that reduces errors by modelling sequential dependencies between the annotations as well as the ground-truth labels. By taking a Bayesian approach, we account for uncertainty in the model due to both annotator errors and the lack of data for modelling annotators who complete few tasks. We evaluate our model on crowdsourced data for named entity recognition, information extraction and argument mining, showing that our sequential model outperforms the previous state of the art. We also find that our approach can reduce crowdsourcing costs through more effective active learning, as it better captures uncertainty in the sequence labels when there are few annotations. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Annotating data is an important task in applying machine learning to NLP applications. A common approach to improve the system performance is to train on a large and high-quality set of training data that is annotated by experts. Besides, active learning (AL) and self-learning can be utilized to reduce the annotation costs. The self-learning method discovers highly reliable instances based on a trained classifier, while AL queries the most informative instances based on active query algorithms. This paper proposes a method that combines AL and self-learning to reduce the labeling effort for the named entity recognition task from tweet streams by using both machine-labeled and manually-labeled data. We employ AL queries based on the diversity of the context and content of instances to select the most informative instances. The conditional random fields are also chosen as an underlying model to train a classifier for selecting highly reliable instances. The experiments using Twitter data show that the proposed method achieves good results in reducing the human labeling effort, and it can significantly improve the performance of the systems. © 2017                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: self learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 10.1016/j.knosys.2017.06.023                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Named entity recognition is a basic and core task of Web farming. However, the existing named entity recognition methods mainly depend on the complete, high-quality and well-labelled data sets and cannot meet the requirements of real-world applications. This paper proposes a continuous learning method for recognizing named entity by introducing the Web farming mode of Web Intelligence into the recognizing process. During the on-line stage, the domain contextual relevance of candidate entities is calculated by using the domain discrimination degree and the domain dependence function for recognizing the target entities. During the off-line stage, an active learning approach is designed to continuously improve the target corpus set by binding density-based clustering with semantic distance measurement. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of entity recognition and is more suitable for real-world applications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: stream based AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1007/s11280-019-00758-x                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 1               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Consequently, critical conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making. Recent studies demonstrated the potential for computer vision to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based biodiversity surveys; however, the literature has focused on projects with a large set of labelled training images, and hence many projects with a smaller set of labelled images cannot benefit from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even sizable projects have struggled to adopt computer vision methods because classification models overfit to specific image backgrounds (i.e. camera locations). In this paper, we combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence via a novel active learning system to minimize the manual work required to train a computer vision model. Furthermore, we utilize object detection models and transfer learning to prevent overfitting to camera locations. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply an active learning approach to camera trap images. Our proposed scheme can match state-of-the-art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset with as few as 14,100 manual labels, which means decreasing manual labelling effort by over 99.5%. Our trained models are also less dependent on background pixels, since they operate only on cropped regions around animals. The proposed active deep learning scheme can significantly reduce the manual labour required to extract information from camera trap images. Automation of information extraction will not only benefit existing camera trap projects, but can also catalyse the deployment of larger camera trap arrays. © 2020 British Ecological Society                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1111/2041-210X.13504                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Therefore, designing a new integrated solution for Chinese historical NER, including automatic entity extraction and man-machine cooperative annotation, is quite valuable for improving the effectiveness of Chinese historical NER and fostering the development of low-resource information extraction. Design/methodology/approach: The research provides a systematic approach for Chinese historical NER with a three-stage framework. In addition to the stage of basic preprocessing, the authors create, retrain and yield a high-performance NER model only using limited labeled resources during the stage of augmented deep active learning (ADAL), which entails three steps—DNN-based NER modeling, hybrid pool-based sampling (HPS) based on the active learning (AL), and NER-oriented data augmentation (DA). ADAL is thought to have the capacity to maintain the performance of DNN as high as possible under the few-shot constraint. Then, to realize machine-aided quality control in crowdsourcing settings, the authors design a stage of globally-optimized automatic label consolidation (GALC). The core of GALC is a newly-designed label consolidation model called simulated annealing-based automatic label aggregation (“SA-ALC”), which incorporates the factors of worker reliability and global label estimation. The model can assure the annotation quality of those data from a crowdsourcing annotation system. Findings: Extensive experiments on two types of Chinese classical historical datasets show that the authors’ solution can effectively reduce the corpus dependency of a DNN-based NER model and alleviate the problem of label quality. Moreover, the results also show the superior performance of the authors’ pipeline approaches (i.e. HPS + DA and SA-ALC) compared to equivalent baselines in each stage. Originality/value: The study sheds new light on the automatic extraction of Chinese historical entities in an all-technological-process integration. The solution is helpful to effectively reducing the annotation cost and controlling the labeling quality for the NER task. It can be further applied to similar tasks of information extraction and other low-resource fields in theoretical and practical ways. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1108/AJIM-03-2022-0107                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The training performance is limited with few labelled data. One solution is active learning, which can achieve ideal results by multi-round sampling strategy to augment unlabelled data. However, there is very few labelled data in the early rounds, which leads to slow improvement on training performance. We thus propose a framework of data augmentation while active learning. To validate our claims, we focus on Chinese NER task and carry out extensive experiments on two public datasets. Experimental results show that our framework is effective for a series of classical query strategy. We can achieve 99% of the best deep model trained on full data using only 22% of the data on Resume, 63% labelled data is reduced as compared to pure active learning (PAL). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 10.1007/978-3-030-82147-0_8                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For person names, it employs two Support Vector Machines, that scan the input text in two passes, and active learning, which reduces the human annotation effort during training. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1007/11752912_22                         | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Annotating data is one of the significant issues in applying machine learning approaches to these sources. Active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) are two distinct approaches to reduce annotation costs. The SSL approach exploits highconfidence samples and AL queries the most informative samples. Thus they can produce better results when jointly applied. This paper proposes a combination of AL and SSL to reduce the labeling effort for named entity recognition (NER) from tweet streams by using both machine-labeled and manually-labeled data. The AL query algorithms select the most informative samples to label those done by a human annotator. In addition, Conditional Random Field (CRF) is chosen as an underlying model to select high-confidence samples. The experiment results on a tweet dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising results in reducing the human labeling effort and that it can significantly improve the performance of NER systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 10.1007/978-3-319-54472-4_25                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, there are now several proposed approaches involving either cross-lingual transfer learning, which learns from other highly resourced languages, or active learning, which efficiently selects effective training data based on model predictions. This paper poses the question: given this recent progress, and limited human annotation, what is the most effective method for efficiently creating high-quality entity recognizers in under-resourced languages? Based on extensive experimentation using both simulated and real human annotation, we find a dual-strategy approach best, starting with a cross-lingual transferred model, then performing targeted annotation of only uncertain entity spans in the target language, minimizing annotator effort. Results demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer is a powerful tool when very little data can be annotated, but an entity-targeted annotation strategy can achieve competitive accuracy quickly, with just one-tenth of training data.

This paper describes the development of the AL-CRF model, which is a NER approach based on active learning (AL). The algorithmic sequence of the processes performed by the AL-CRF model is the following: first, the samples are clustered using the k-means approach. Then, stratified sampling is performed on the produced clusters in order to obtain initial samples, which are used to train the basic conditional random field (CRF) classifier. The next step includes the initiation of the selection process which uses the criterion of entropy. More specifically, samples having the highest entropy values are added to the training set. Afterwards, the learning process is repeated, and the CRF classifier is retrained based on the obtained training set. The learning and the selection process of the AL is running iteratively until the harmonic mean F stabilizes and the final NER model is obtained. Several NER experiments are performed on legislative and medical cases in order to validate the AL-CRF performance. The testing data include Chinese judicial documents and Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). Testing indicates that our proposed algorithm has better recognition accuracy and recall rate compared to the conventional CRF model. Moreover, the main advantage of our approach is that it requires fewer manually labelled training samples, and at the same time, it is more effective. This can result in a more cost effective and more reliable process. © 2018 Han Huang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1155/2018/1890683                        | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French. We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn and evaluate several classification models that can be configured in a cascaded pipeline. We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set. We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca. 83% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features. The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca. 70 and 68% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns. In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages.

Electronic Medical Record (EMR) belongs to text data of the specific professional field. The annotation of this kind of data needs experts with strong knowledge of the medical field and time labeling. To tackle the problems of professional medical areas, large data volume, and annotation difficulties of EMR, we propose a new method based on multi-standard active learning to recognize entities in EMR. Our approach uses three criteria: the number of labeled data, the cost of sentence annotation, and the balance of data sampling to determine the choice of active learning strategy. We put forward a more suitable way of uncertainty calculation and measurement rule of sentence annotation for NER’s neural network model. Also, we use incremental training to speed up the iterative training in the process of active learning. Finally, the named entity experiment of breast clinical EMRs shows that it can achieve the same accuracy of NER results under the premise of obtaining the same sample’s quality. Compared with the traditional supervised learning method of randomly selecting labeled data, the method proposed in this paper reduces the amount of data that needs to be labeled by 66.67%. Besides, an improved TF-IDF method based on Word2Vec is also proposed to vectorize the text by considering the word frequency. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.3934/MBE.2021054                         | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Financial yearbooks are historical records reporting on information about the companies of stock exchanges. This paper concentrates on the description of the key components that implement a financial information extraction system from financial yearbooks. The proposed system consists in three steps: OCR, linked named entities extraction, active learning. The core of the system is related to linked named entities extraction (LNE). LNE are coherent n-tuple of named entities describing high level semantic information. In this respect we developed, tested and compared a CRF and a hybrid RNN/CRF based system. Active learning allows to cope with the lack of annotated data for training the system. Promising performance results are reported on two yearbooks (the French Desfossé yearbook (1962) and the German Handbuch (1914–15)) and for two LNE extraction tasks: capital information of companies and constitution information of companies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL strategy not named | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["They use the active learning as auto-labeling", "Not much info about the AL strategy used"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 10.1007/978-3-030-57058-3_23                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 1                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Unlike formal text, such as news articles and pieces of longer content, tweets are of a specific nature: Short, noisy, and with dynamic content. Thus, it is difficult to apply the traditional natural language processing algorithms to analyze them. Active learning is well-suited to many problems in natural language processing, especially when unlabeled data may be abundant, but labeled data is limited. The method proposed here aims to minimize annotation costs while maximizing the desired performance from the model. The method recognizes named entities from tweet streams on Twitter by using an active learning method with different query strategies. The tweets are queried for labeling by a human annotator based on query-by-committee, uncertainty-based sampling, and diversity-based sampling.

A new method combined Active Learning with Self-Training is proposed, which selects samples based on confidence and 2-Gram frequency, and expands the training set by annotating the unlabeled corpus manually and automatically. The experiments reveal that the F-measure of this method is 8% higher than randomized Active Learning while the annotation is only 1/3 of the latter. And using this method, only 5% of characters in the extended training set need to be labeled to acquire a similar performance with complete manual annotation. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: self training                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.791-793.2031 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Consequently, there is a significant manual cost to collecting training samples when processing new images. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel active transfer learning method, which combines active learning and the deep forest model to perform transfer learning. The main idea of the proposed method is to gradually improve the performance of the model in target domain tasks with the increase of the levels of the cascade structure. More specifically, in the growing stage, a new active learning strategy is used to iteratively add the most informative target domain samples to the training set, and the augmented features generated by the representation learning capability of the deep forest model are used to improve the cross-domain representational capabilities of the feature space. In the filtering stage, an effective stopping criterion is used to adaptively control the complexity of the model, and two filtering strategies are used to accelerate the convergence of the model. We conducted experiments using three sets of PolSAR images, and the results were compared with those of four existing transfer learning algorithms. Overall, the experimental results fully demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. ©                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.3390/RS12172755                          | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This data is extremely heterogeneous, and so, it is hard to analyze and derive information from this data that is considered an indispensable source for decision-makers. Due to this massive growth, the classification of data and analysis has become an important research subject. Extracting information from this data has become a necessity. As a result, it was necessary to process these enormous volumes of data to uncover hidden information and therefore improve data analysis and, in turn, classification accuracy. In this paper, firstly, we focus on developing an ensemble machine-learning model based on active learning which identifies the most effective feature extraction strategy for heterogeneous data analysis, and compare it with traditional machine-learning algorithms. Secondly, we evaluate the proposed model during the experiments; five heterogeneous datasets from various domains were used, such as a Health Care Reform dataset, Sander Frandsen dataset, Financial Phrase Bank dataset, SMS Spam Collection dataset, and Textbook sales dataset.

This makes active learning (AL) an important part of an image analysis framework. AL aims to efficiently build a representative and efficient library of training samples that are most informative for the underlying classification task, thereby minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data. Based on ranked batch-mode active learning (RBMAL), this paper proposes a novel combined query strategy of spectral information divergence lowest confidence uncertainty sampling (SIDLC), called RBSIDLC. The base classifier of random forest (RF) is initialized by using a small initial training set, and each unlabeled sample is analyzed to obtain the classification uncertainty score. A spectral information divergence (SID) function is then used to calculate the similarity score, and according to the final score, the unlabeled samples are ranked in descending lists. The most “valuable” samples are selected according to ranked lists and then labeled by the analyst/expert (also called the oracle). Finally, these samples are added to the training set, and the RF is retrained for the next iteration. The whole procedure is iteratively implemented until a stopping criterion is met. The results indicate that RBSIDLC achieves high-precision extraction of urban land use information based on VHRRS; the accuracy of extraction for each land-use type is greater than 90%, and the overall accuracy (OA) is greater than 96%. After the SID replaces the Euclidean distance in the RBMAL algorithm, the RBSIDLC method greatly reduces the misclassification rate among different land types. Therefore, the similarity function based on SID performs better than that based on the Euclidean distance. In addition, the OA of RF classification is greater than 90%, suggesting that it is feasible to use RF to estimate the uncertainty score. Compared with the three single query strategies of other AL methods, sample labeling with the SIDLC combined query strategy yields a lower cost and higher quality, thus effectively reducing the misclassification rate of different land use types. For example, compared with the Batch_Based_Entropy (BBE) algorithm, RBSIDLC improves the precision of barren land extraction by 37% and that of vegetation by 14%. The 25 characteristics of different land use types screened by RF cross-validation (RFCV) combined with the permutation method exhibit an excellent separation degree, and the results provide the basis for VHRRS information extraction in urban land use settings based on RBSIDLC. © 2021 by the authors.

In this algorithm, three measures of diversity, i.e., double-fault measure, disagreement metric and correlation coefficient, are applied to select the optimal classifier combination from different classifiers, e.g., support vector machine (SVM), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), extreme learning machine (ELM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Then, unlabeled samples are selected using an active learning (AL) method, and consistent results of any other two classifiers combined with a spatial neighborhood information extraction strategy are employed to predict their labels. Moreover, a multi-scale homogeneity (MSH) method is utilized to refine the classification result with the highest accuracy in the classifier combination, generating the final classification result. Experiments on three real hyperspectral data indicate that the proposed approach can effectively improve classification performance. © 2016 by the authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.3390/rs8090749                           | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this algorithm, the RLDE method is used for optimal feature information extraction, to solve the problems of singular values and over-fitting, which are the main problems in the local discriminant embedding (LDE) and local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA) methods. An active learning method is then used to select the most useful and informative samples from the candidate set. In the experiments undertaken in this study, the three base classifiers were multinomial logistic regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF). To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed RLDE method, experiments were conducted on two real hyperspectral datasets (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer (ROSIS)), and the proposed RLDE tri-training algorithm was compared with its counterparts of tri-training alone, LDE, and LFDA. The experiments confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively improve the classification accuracy for hyperspectral imagery. © 2019 by the authors.

The critical question is how much and which subset of data should be annotated for better model performance under budget constraints. Though most of the Machine Learning (ML) research focuses on learning better models using annotated datasets, this paper focuses on data annotation, specifically on suitable subset selection with an emphasis on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for cybersecurity. The proposed method provides an active learning based sampling strategy to select minimal yet most informative samples from a large set. Further, reinforcement learning is combined with the active learning approach to automate the process of sampling. The results on the auto-labelled cyber-NER dataset indicate that the cyber-NER model with Reinforced Active Learning (RAL) based sampling increases F1-Score by +2-7% and reduces compute time by 90% compared to random sampling based subset selection. Further, the proposed RAL approach achieved an 80% reduction in sample size and, consequently, annotation cost with comparable accuracy to that of complete selection. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: reinforcement-learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1109/OCIT56763.2022.00066                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The patterns are reduced regular expressions composed of various characteristics of features useful in information extraction. Our major contribution is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that extracts information from a set of examples labeled as relevant or irrelevant to a given attribute. The approach is semi-supervised because it does not require precise labeling of the exact location of features in the training data. This significantly reduces the effort needed to develop a training set. An active learning algorithm is used to assist the semi-supervised learning algorithm to further reduce the training set development effort. The active learning algorithm is seeded with a single positive example of a given attribute. The context of the seed is used to automatically identify candidates for additional positive examples of the given attribute. Candidate examples are manually pruned during the active learning phase, and our semi-supervised learning algorithm automatically discovers reduced regular expressions for each attribute. We have successfully applied this learning technique in the extraction of textual features from police incident reports, university crime reports, and patents. The performance of our algorithm compares favorably with competitive extraction systems being used in criminal justice information systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1002/asi.20119                           | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We use a semi-supervised approach which uses a small annotated corpus and a large raw corpus for the Hindi NER task using maximum entropy classifier. A novel statistical annotation confidence measure is proposed for the purpose. The confidence measure is used in selective sampling based semi-supervised NER. Also a prior modulation of maximum entropy classifier is used where the annotation confidence values are used as 'prior weight'. The superiority of the proposed technique over baseline classifier is demonstrated extensively through experiments. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1007/978-3-642-11164-8_36                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While a lot of papers have been presented on applying AL to natural language processing tasks reporting impressive savings, little work has been done on defining a stopping criterion. In this work, we present a stopping criterion for active learning based on the way instances are selected during uncertainty-based sampling and verify its applicability in a variety of settings. The statistical learning models used in our study are support vector machines (SVMs), maximum entropy models and Bayesian logistic regression and the tasks performed are text classification, named entity recognition and shallow parsing. In addition, we present a method for multiclass mutually exclusive SVM active learning. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Machine learning (ML) based approaches can achieve good performance, but they often require large amounts of annotated samples, which are expensive to build due to the requirement of domain experts in annotation. Active learning (AL), a sample selection approach integrated with supervised ML, aims to minimize the annotation cost while maximizing the performance of ML-based models. In this study, our goal was to develop and evaluate both existing and new AL methods for a clinical NER task to identify concepts of medical problems, treatments, and lab tests from the clinical notes. Methods: Using the annotated NER corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge that contained 349 clinical documents with 20,423 unique sentences, we simulated AL experiments using a number of existing and novel algorithms in three different categories including uncertainty-based, diversity-based, and baseline sampling strategies. They were compared with the passive learning that uses random sampling. Learning curves that plot performance of the NER model against the estimated annotation cost (based on number of sentences or words in the training set) were generated to evaluate different active learning and the passive learning methods and the area under the learning curve (ALC) score was computed. Results: Based on the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of sentences, uncertainty sampling algorithms outperformed all other methods in ALC. Most diversity-based methods also performed better than random sampling in ALC. To achieve an F-measure of 0.80, the best method based on uncertainty sampling could save 66% annotations in sentences, as compared to random sampling. For the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of words, uncertainty sampling methods again outperformed all other methods in ALC. To achieve 0.80 in F-measure, in comparison to random sampling, the best uncertainty based method saved 42% annotations in words. But the best diversity based method reduced only 7% annotation effort. Conclusion: In the simulated setting, AL methods, particularly uncertainty-sampling based approaches, seemed to significantly save annotation cost for the clinical NER task. The actual benefit of active learning in clinical NER should be further evaluated in a real-time setting. © 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 91 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.09.010                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper we present a system that generates MCQs automatically using a sports domain text as input. All the sentences in a text are not capable of generating MCQs; the first step of the system is to select the informative sentences. We propose a novel technique to select informative sentences by using topic modeling and parse structure similarity. The parse structure similarity is computed between the parse structure of an input sentence and a set of reference parse structures. In order to compile the reference set we use a number of existing MCQs collected from the web. Keyword selection is done with the help of occurrence of domain specific word and named entity word in the sentence. Distractors are generated using a set of rules and name dictionary. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique is quite accurate. © 2015 Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques for Educational Applications, NLP-TEA 2015 - in conjunction with the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, ACL-IJCNLP 2015.

However, manually sifting through thousands of articles for new information about modelled entities is a painstaking and low-reward task. Text mining can be used to help a curator extract relevant information from this literature in a systematic way. We propose the application of text mining methods for the neuroscience literature. Specifically, two computational neuroscientists annotated a corpus of entities pertinent to neuroscience using active learning techniques to enable swift, targeted annotation. We then trained machine learning models to recognise the entities that have been identified. The entities covered are Neuron Types, Brain Regions, Experimental Values, Units, Ion Currents, Channels, and Conductances and Model organisms. We tested a traditional rule-based approach, a conditional random field and a model using deep learning named entity recognition, finding that the deep learning model was superior. Our final results show that we can detect a range of named entities of interest to the neuroscientist with a macro average precision, recall and F1 score of 0.866, 0.817 and 0.837 respectively. The contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We provide a set of Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools that are capable of detecting neuroscience entities with performance above or similar to prior work. 2) We propose a methodology for training NER tools for neuroscience that requires very little training data to get strong performance. This can be adapted for any sub-domain within neuroscience. 3) We provide a small corpus with annotations for multiple entity types, as well as annotation guidelines to help others reproduce our experiments. © 2018, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1007/s12021-018-9404-y                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In order to achieve the best performance, these systems are generally trained on a large human annotated corpus. Since annotating such corpora is a very expensive and time-consuming procedure, manually annotating corpora is become one of the significant issues in many text based tasks such as text mining, semantic annotation, Named Entity Recognition and generally Information Extraction. Semi-supervised Learning and Active Learning are two distinct approaches that deal with reduction of labeling costs. Based on their natures, Active and semi-supervised learning can produce better results when they are jointly applied. In this paper we propose a combined Semi-Supervised and Active Learning approach for Sequence Labeling which extremely reduces manual annotation cost in a way that only highly uncertain tokens need to be manually labeled and other sequences and subsequences are labeled automatically. The proposed approach reduces manual annotation cost around 90% compare with a supervised learning and 30% in contrast with a similar fully active learning approach. Conditional Random Field (CRF) is chosen as the underlying learning model due to its promising performance in many sequence labeling tasks. In addition we proposed a confidence measure based on the model's variance reduction that reaches a considerable accuracy for finding informative samples. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

Pattern rule induction is one kind of main methods to do information extraction. Manually constructing pattern rules is tedious and error prone. In this paper, we present GRID_CoTrain, a weakly supervised paradigm by bootstrapping GRID (a supervised rule induction system) with cotraining and active learning. We also utilize external knowledge resource such as WordNet and existing ontology knowledge to optimize the learned pattern rules. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-540-37275-2_146               | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active Learning is an approach that deals with reduction of labeling costs. In this paper we proposed an effective active learning approach based on minimal variance that reduces manual annotation cost by using a small number of manually labeled examples. In our approach we use a confidence measure based on the model's variance that reaches a considerable accuracy for annotating entities. Conditional Random Field (CRF) is chosen as the underlying learning model due to its promising performance in many sequence labeling tasks. The experiments show that the proposed method needs considerably fewer manual labeled samples to produce a desirable result. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.1007/978-3-642-18134-4_56                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, the lack of training data (i.e. annotated corpora) makes it difficult for machine learning-based named entity recognizers to be used in building practical information extraction systems. Results: This paper presents an active learning-like framework for reducing the human effort required to create named entity annotations in a corpus. In this framework, the annotation work is performed as an iterative and interactive process between the human annotator and a probabilistic named entity tagger. Unlike active learning, our framework aims to annotate all occurrences of the target named entities in the given corpus, so that the resulting annotations are free from the sampling bias which is inevitable in active learning approaches. Conclusion: We evaluate our framework by simulating the annotation process using two named entity corpora and show that our approach can reduce the number of sentences which need to be examined by the human annotator. The cost reduction achieved by the framework could be drastic when the target named entities are sparse. © 2008 Tsuruoka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1186/1471-2105-9-S11-S8                  | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this framework, the annotation work is performed as an iterative and interactive process between the human annotator and a probabilistic named entity tagger. At each iteration, sentences that are most likely to contain named entities of the target category are selected by the probabilistic tagger and presented to the annotator. This iterative annotation process is repeated until the estimated coverage reaches the desired level. Unlike active learning approaches, our framework produces a named entity corpus that is free from the sampling bias introduced by the active strategy. We evaluated our framework by simulating the annotation process using two named entity corpora and show that our approach could drastically reduce the number of sentences to be annotated when applied to sparse named entities. © 2008 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, there are very few studies of the NER task for open-domain collections and in low-resource settings. We focus on NER for low-resource collections, in which any entity types of practical interest to the users of the system must be supported. We try to achieve this with a low cost of annotation of data from the target domain/collection. We propose an entity recognition framework that combines active learning and conditional random fields (CRF), and which provides the flexibility to define new entity types as needed by the users. Our experiments on a help & support corpus show that the system can achieve F1 measure of 0.77 by relying on only 100 manually-annotated sentences. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Included", "Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["full text screening"], "Yoka"=>["done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 10.1145/3357384.3358109                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

If completely labeled documents are available for training, well-known Markov model techniques can be used to learn such classifiers. In this paper, we consider the more challenging task of learning hidden Markov models (HMMs) when only partially (sparsely) labeled documents are available for training. We first give detailed account of the task and its appropriate loss function, and show how it can be minimized given an HMM. We describe an EM style algorithm for learning HMMs from partially labeled data. We then present an active learning algorithm that selects “difficult” unlabeled tokens and asks the user to label them. We study empirically by how much active learning reduces the required data labeling effort, or increases the quality of the learned model achievable with a given amount of user effort. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 307 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["Dataset is an additional information.

Such algorithms assume training-time access to an expert that can provide the optimal action at any queried state; unfortunately, the number of such queries is often prohibitive, frequently rendering these approaches impractical. To combat this query complexity, we consider an active learning setting in which the learning algorithm has additional access to a much cheaper noisy heuristic that provides noisy guidance. Our algorithm, LEAQI, learns a difference classifier that predicts when the expert is likely to disagree with the heuristic, and queries the expert only when necessary. We apply LEAQI to three sequence labeling tasks, demonstrating significantly fewer queries to the expert and comparable (or better) accuracies over a passive approach. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Its aim is to identify and to classify the named entities in the textual data into predetermined categories. There are a large number of supervised learning and deep learning models being developed for the entity recognition task, which performs well in the presence of a labeled training set. The availability of the labeled training set requires the labeling of large unlabeled data, which is both expensive and time taking. Active learning is an iterative approach that provides a way to minimize labeling cost without affecting performance. This approach uses a sampling strategy that selects the appropriate unlabeled data instances, an oracle to label the selected data instances, and a machine learning model (base classifier). In this work, a modified least confidence-based query sampling strategy for the active learning approach for named entity recognition task has been proposed, which considers different numbers of uncertain words present within the sentences to compute the final least confidence score of the sentence for comparison. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the comparison of the performance is made among the active learning approaches with the proposed sampling strategy, random sampling strategy, and two other well-known existing uncertainty query sampling strategies. Real-world scenario for active learning approach is simulated for experiment, and the total amount of labeled data required for training of active learner to reach the stop condition while using different sampling strategies is recorded. The experiment is carried for the development and the test set of the three different biomedical corpora and a Spanish language NER corpus. It is found that with the proposed active learning approach, there is a minimal requirement of labeled data for training to reach the above performance level in comparison with the other approaches. The performance of the proposed approach is found to be slightly better than the existing sampling approach, and the performance of all the approaches is far better than the random sampling approach. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1007/s13748-021-00230-w                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We investigate several active learning approaches in which the user annotates only one desired extraction and then merely answers extraction queries generated by the system. The resulting framework is attractive because it is the system, not the user, which digs out the data in search of the samples most suitable to the specific learning task. We tailor our proposals to a state-of-the-art learner based on Genetic Programming and we assess them experimentally on a number of challenging tasks of realistic complexity. The results indicate that active learning is indeed a viable framework in this application domain and may thus significantly decrease the amount of costly annotation effort required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/2851613.2851668                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, there is a limited quantity of labeled pre-plans data due to the high labeling cost. This paper proposes an active learning-based sequence labeling method, aiming at achieving good deep learning model performance with only a small amount of labeled data. It proposes a sample selection strategy based on uncertainty and slot, in which the uncertainty and slot respectively represent the informativeness and representativeness of the sample. Meanwhile, to avoid getting into local details in each round of model training, a method for evaluating the performance of data labeling is proposed. Based on these two works, the active learning and data labeling processes are also present. We use four strategies as comparative methods in our experiment, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms other active learning methods. We conclude that our method is efficient and applicable to tasks involving the labeling of textual data in other contexts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Included", "Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-031-36819-6_33                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we apply active learning to domain adaptation for named entity recognition systems, propose various sampling optimizations, and show that the labeling effort can be reduced by over 92% while achieving the same performance as supervised method. Named entity recognition can be effectively applied to information extraction, machine translation, text classification and many other areas. We propose a new application area for named entity recognition, namely in natural language information hiding: A novel coverless information hiding method based on text big data is proposed, utilizing named entities to mark the locations of the hidden information. Coverless information hiding is a brand new area of information hiding that achieves the transmission of hidden information without any modification in the carrier text. Furthermore, active learning allows our information hiding method to be applied to text from new domains without substantial labeling effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose an active learning approach in which the machine solicits "labels" on features rather than instances. In both simulated and real user experiments on two sequence labeling tasks we show that our active learning method outperforms passive learning with features as well as traditional active learning with instances. Preliminary experiments suggest that novel interfaces which intelligently solicit labels on multiple features facilitate more efficient annotation. © 2009 ACL and AFNLP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 109 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: feature AL,explainable AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 10.3115/1699510.1699522                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 2     |

Supervised models for aspect term extraction require large amount of labeled data. Aspect annotated data is scarcely available for use and the cost of manual annotation of the entire data is huge. This study proposes a way of using Active Learning to select a highly informative subset of the data that needs to be labeled, to train the supervised model. The identification of aspect terms is defined as a sequence labelling problem with the help of BiLSTM network and CRF. The model is trained on publicly available SemEval (2014–16) datasets for restaurant and laptop reviews. The results show a 36% and 42% reduction in annotation cost for restaurants and laptops respectively, with negligible effect on the model’s performance. A significant difference in cost is observed between active learning guided sampling and random sampling approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-981-16-0401-0_27                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active Learning (AL) is a technique developed to reduce the amount of annotation required to achieve a certain level of machine learning model performance. In information extraction and text classification, AL can reduce the amount of labor up to multiple times. Despite its potential for aiding expensive annotation, as far as we know, there were no effective AL query strategies for ATS. This stems from the fact that many AL strategies rely on uncertainty estimation, while as we show in our work, uncertain instances are usually noisy, and selecting them can degrade the model performance compared to passive annotation. We address this problem by proposing the first effective query strategy for AL in ATS based on diversity principles. We show that given a certain annotation budget, using our strategy in AL annotation helps to improve the model performance in terms of ROUGE and consistency scores. Additionally, we analyze the effect of self-learning and show that it can further increase the performance of the model. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While the sequence labeling formulation is the major approach, we explore a method that takes examples of terms as input and outputs phrases in the same category as the given terms to avoid the heavy cost for building a training dataset. The existing methods in this direction are template-based, which the user cannot give any feedback to the system even if some of the extracted terms are not intended. This paper proposes a framework for extracting technical terms that considers the user's feedback by adopting active learning approach. The proposed method can extract terms consisting of multiple words by dynamically accessing an inverted index created in advance. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the straightforward application of active learning to an existing method. © 2021 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1145/3487664.3487706                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We propose an algorithm called Majority-CRF that uses an ensemble of classification models to guide the selection of relevant utterances, as well as a sequence labeling model to help prioritize informative examples. Experiments with three domains show that Majority-CRF achieves 6.6%-9% relative error rate reduction compared to random sampling with the same annotation budget, and statistically significant improvements compared to other AL approaches. Additionally, case studies with human-in-the-loop AL on six new domains show 4.6%-9% improvement on an existing NLU system. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning is to choose the most informative documents for the supervised learning in order to reduce the amount of required manual annotations. Previous works of active learning, however, focused on the tasks of entity recognition and protein-protein interactions, but not on event extraction tasks for multiple event types. They also did not consider the evidence of event participants, which might be a clue for the presence of events in unlabeled documents. Moreover, the confidence scores of events produced by event extraction systems are not reliable for ranking documents in terms of informativity for supervised learning. We here propose a novel committee-based active learning method that supports multi-event extraction tasks and employs a new statistical method for informativity estimation instead of using the confidence scores from event extraction systems. Methods: Our method is based on a committee of two systems as follows: We first employ an event extraction system to filter potential false negatives among unlabeled documents, from which the system does not extract any event. We then develop a statistical method to rank the potential false negatives of unlabeled documents 1) by using a language model that measures the probabilities of the expression of multiple events in documents and 2) by using a named entity recognition system that locates the named entities that can be event arguments (e.g. proteins). The proposed method further deals with unknown words in test data by using word similarity measures. We also apply our active learning method for the task of named entity recognition. Results and conclusion: We evaluate the proposed method against the BioNLP Shared Tasks datasets, and show that our method can achieve better performance than such previous methods as entropy and Gibbs error based methods and a conventional committee-based method. We also show that the incorporation of named entity recognition into the active learning for event extraction and the unknown word handling further improve the active learning method. In addition, the adaptation of the active learning method into named entity recognition tasks also improves the document selection for manual annotation of named entities. © 2016 Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: multi-task AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1186/s13326-016-0059-z                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 1             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This objective function, called the policy Gibbs error, is the expected error rate of a random classifier drawn from the prior distribution on the examples adaptively selected by the active learning policy. Exact maximization of the policy Gibbs error is hard, so we propose a greedy strategy that maximizes the Gibbs error at each iteration, where the Gibbs error on an instance is the expected error of a random classifier selected from the posterior label distribution on that instance. We apply this maximum Gibbs error criterion to three active learning scenarios: non-adaptive, adaptive, and batch active learning. In each scenario, we prove that the criterion achieves near-maximal policy Gibbs error when constrained to a fixed budget. For practical implementations, we provide approximations to the maximum Gibbs error criterion for Bayesian conditional random fields and transductive Naive Bayes. Our experimental results on a named entity recognition task and a text classification task show that the maximum Gibbs error criterion is an effective active learning criterion for noisy models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We present LGCo-Testing, an active learning system for relation type extension based on local and global views of relation instances. Locally, we extract features from the sentence that contains the instance. Globally, we measure the distributional similarity between instances from a 2 billion token corpus. Evaluation on the ACE 2004 corpus shows that LGCo-Testing can reduce annotation cost by 97% while maintaining the performance level of supervised learning. © 2012 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1145/2396761.2398409                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We propose a new active learning framework for sequence labelling which take the change of probability into account. At each iteration of the proposed method, every time the human annotator manually annotates a token, the output probabilities of the other tokens in the sequence are re-estimated. This proposed method is expected to reduce the amount of human annotation required for obtaining a high labelling performance. Through experiments on the NP chunking dataset provided by CoNLL, we empirically show that the proposed method works well. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not model agnostic,semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 10.1007/978-3-642-15246-7_69                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 1                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Recent advances in transfer learning for natural language processing in conjunction with active learning open the possibility to significantly reduce the necessary annotation budget. We are the first to thoroughly investigate this powerful combination for the sequence tagging task. We conduct an extensive empirical study of various Bayesian uncertainty estimation methods and Monte Carlo dropout options for deep pre-trained models in the active learning framework and find the best combinations for different types of models. Besides, we also demonstrate that to acquire instances during active learning, a full-size Transformer can be substituted with a distilled version, which yields better computational performance and reduces obstacles for applying deep active learning in practice. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, this information is often intermingled with various formatting, layout, and textual metadata, making it hard to identify and extract the actual tabularly structured payload. For this reason, automated information extraction from spreadsheets is a challenging task. Previous papers proposed cell classification as a first step of the table extraction process, which, however, requires a substantial amount of labeled training data, that is expensive to obtain. Therefore, in this paper we investigate a semi-supervised approach called Active Learning (AL), that can be used to train classification models by selecting only the most informative examples from an unlabeled dataset. In detail, we implement an AL cycle for spreadsheet cell classification by investigating different selection strategies and stopping criteria. We compare the performance of various AL strategies and derive guidelines for semi-supervised cell classification. Our experiments show, that by implementing AL for cell classification, we are able to reduce the amount of training data by 90% without any accuracy losses compared to a passive classifier. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We describe an active learning framework that is not aimed at synthesizing a solution from scratch, but rather is aimed at selecting a solution from a set of more than 3000 solutions that have already proven useful in a broad range of practical applications. The user provides only one example of desired extraction and then interactively annotates text snippets selected by the system. The system constructs such queries based on uncertainty sampling, i.e., by selecting the snippet on which it is most uncertain at each learning step. The resulting framework allows solving many practical extraction problems quickly and simply. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

Supervised temporal relation classification requires large corpora which are difficult, time consuming, and expensive to produce. Active learning strategies are well-suited to reduce this effort by efficiently selecting the most informative samples for labeling. This paper presents novel active learning strategies based on support vector machines (SVM) for temporal relation classification. A large number of empirical comparisons of different active learning algorithms and various kernel functions in SVM shows that proposed active learning strategies are effective for the given task. © 2011 AFNLP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) under wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We develop a method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learner, Conditional Random Field (CRF). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity extraction from biomedical domain. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system. © 2012 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1145/2345396.2345532                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It is very costly and difficult to label the unlabelled data. The active learning approach can be used in this case as it selects the most appropriate data from the unlabeled data pool. In this work, we have applied active learning using CRF classifier over biomedical disease names and adverse effect corpus using margin sampling strategy. Experiment have been carried for selecting the most uncertain samples for labeling by defining different threshold values for the margin used to measure the uncertainty. The active learning approach performs well with much less data requirement and its performance increases with the increase in threshold values of the margin. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1007/978-981-15-3125-5_18                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In particular, the tasks of definition and result extraction from scientific publications in Russian are considered. We note that annotation of scientific texts for creation of training dataset is very labor insensitive and expensive process. To tackle this problem, we propose methods and tools based on active learning. We describe and evaluate a novel adaptive density-weighted sampling (ADWeS) meta-strategy for active learning. The experiments demonstrate that active learning can be a very efficient technique for scientific text mining, and the proposed meta-strategy can be beneficial for corpus annotation with strongly skewed class distribution. We also investigate informative task-independent features for information extraction from scientific texts and present an openly available tool for corpus annotation, which is equipped with ADWeS and compatible with well-known sampling strategies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-319-71746-3_7                 | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Two approaches that reduce the cost of annotation are active learning and crowd-sourcing. However, these two approaches have not been combined successfully to date. We evaluate the utility of active learning in crowdsourcing on two tasks, named entity recognition and sentiment detection, and show that active learning outperforms random selection of annotation examples in a noisy crowdsourcing scenario. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Included", "Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["Investigate strategies and corpora"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this study, we propose an active learning approach for Arabic Named Entity Recognition (ANER) using the pre-trained language model AraGPT2. Our approach utilizes the model’s uncertainty in making predictions to select the most informative examples for annotation, reducing the need for a large annotated dataset. We evaluated our approach on three datasets: AQMAR, NEWS, and TWEETS. The results demonstrate that our active learning approach outperforms state-of-the-art models and tools such as MADAMIRA, FARASA, and Deep Co-learning methods on AQMAR and NEWS datasets. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robustness on TWEETS dataset, which primarily contains text written in the Egyptian dialect and often includes mistakes or misspellings. Our findings suggest that the active learning approach can significantly improve the performance of ANER models, particularly when dealing with noisy or dialectal text. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 10.1007/978-3-031-41774-0_18                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It has been shown that active learning can be successfully applied to sequence tagging tasks of text processing in conjunction with deep learning models even when a limited amount of labeled data is available. Recent advances in transfer learning methods for natural language processing based on deep pre-trained models such as ELMo and BERT offer a much better ability to generalize on small annotated datasets compared to their shallow counterparts. The combination of deep pre-trained models and active learning leads to a powerful approach to dealing with annotation scarcity. In this work, we investigate the potential of this approach on clinical and biomedical data. The experimental evaluation shows that the combination of active learning and deep pre-trained models outperforms the standard methods of active learning. We also suggest a modification to a standard uncertainty sampling strategy and empirically show that it could be beneficial for annotation of very skewed datasets. Finally, we propose an annotation tool empowered with active learning and deep pre-trained models that could be used for entity annotation directly from Jupyter IDE. © 2019 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983157              | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It has been widely applied for information extraction, classification, and filtering. Most existing active learning methods do not consider image noise separately to guide the selection of informative examples, which might lead to sub-optimal annotation. Due to the intrinsic presence of noise in images, large amount of images, and varied imaging modalities, using active learning for medical image annotation is an even more challenging task. In this study, we develop a novel low-rank modeling-based multi-label active learning (LRMMAL) method for effective medical image annotation. Different to those traditional active learning methods, the LRMMAL method innovatively measures image noise and combines it with the measures of example label uncertainty and label correlation into a new sampling process to determine most informative examples for annotation. Experimental results on thoracic CT images and comparisons with other four multi-label active learning methods illustrate the superior performance of the LRMMAL method. © 2018 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363578                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Furthermore, NER is often more complicated when working with scientific text. For example, in polymer science, chemical structure may be encoded using nonstandard naming conventions, the same concept can be expressed using many different terms (synonymy), and authors may refer to polymers with ad-hoc labels. These challenges, which are not unique to polymer science, make it difficult to generate training data, as specialized skills are needed to label text correctly. We have previously designed polyNER, a semi-Automated system for efficient identification of scientific entities in text. PolyNER applies word embedding models to generate entity-rich corpora for productive expert labeling, and then uses the resulting labeled data to bootstrap a context-based classifier. PolyNER facilitates a labeling process that is otherwise tedious and expensive. Here, we use active learning to efficiently obtain more annotations from experts and improve performance. Our approach requires just five hours of expert time to achieve discrimination capacity comparable to that of a state-of-The-Art chemical NER toolkit. © 2019 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1109/eScience.2019.00021                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Supervised learning methods can achieve high performance but they require a large amount of training data that is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Active learning (AL) is well-suited to many problems in NLP, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labeled data is limited. The AL method aims to minimize annotation costs while maximizing the desired performance from the model. This study proposes a method to classify named entities from Tweet streams on Twitter by using an AL method with different query strategies. The samples were queried for labeling by human annotators based on query by committee and diversity-based querying. The experiments evaluated the proposed method on Tweet data and achieved promising results that proved better than the baseline. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: stream based AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 10.1007/978-3-319-43982-2_28                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 1               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This named entity type is known to be hard to delineate and capture by annotation guidelines. We here propose a two-category encoding schema where we distinguish short from long mention spans, the first covering standardized terminology (e.g. diseases), the latter accounting for less structured descriptive statements about norm-deviant states, as well as criteria and observations that might signal pathologies. The second design decision relates to the way annotation instances are sampled. Here we subscribe to an Active Learning-based approach which is known to save annotation costs without sacrificing annotation quality by means of a sample bias. By design, Active Learning picks up 'hard' to annotate instances for human annotators, whereas 'easier' ones are passed over to the automatic classifier whose models already incorporate and gradually improve with previous annotation experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) into wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian languages, namely Hindi and Bengali. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system. © 2012 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/2345396.2345427                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Previous OpenRE methods mainly suffer from two problems: (1) Insufficient capacity to discriminate between known and novel relations. When extending conventional test settings to a more general setting where test data might also come from seen classes, existing approaches have a significant performance decline. (2) Secondary labeling must be performed before practical application. Existing methods cannot label human-readable and meaningful types for novel relations, which is urgently required by the downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose the Active Relation Discovery (ARD) framework, which utilizes relational outlier detection for discriminating known and novel relations and involves active learning for labeling novel relations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that ARD significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both conventional and our proposed general OpenRE settings. The source code and datasets will be available for reproducibility. © 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1016/j.knosys.2023.111094                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model. In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently, they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach, Active2 Learning (A2L), actively adapts to the deep learning model being trained to eliminate such redundant examples chosen by an AL strategy. We show that A2L is widely applicable by using it in conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce the data requirements of state-of-the-art AL strategies by ≈ 3 - 25% on an absolute scale on multiple NLP tasks while achieving the same performance with virtually no additional computation overhead. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not model agnostic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 1                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We are given a relational probabilistic database, where each tuple is correct with some probability; e.g., a database constructed from textual data using information extraction. We are now given a query and we want to determine the correctness of its results. Unlike probabilistic databases, we have an oracle that can resolve the uncertainty, such as a domain expert that can verify data against their sources. Since verification may be costly, our goal is to determine the correct output of the query, while asking the oracle to verify as few tuples as possible. ActivePDB provides an end-to-end solution to this problem. In a nutshell, we first track provenance to identify which input tuples contribute to the derivation of each output tuple, and in what ways. We then design an active learning solution to iteratively choose tuples to be verified based on the provenance structure and on an evolving estimation of the probability of the tuples correctness. We will demonstrate ActivePDB in the context of the NELL database of extracted facts, allowing participants to both pose queries and play the role of oracles. © 2022, VLDB Endowment.

The novel contribution of this paper is in investigating two techniques for making SVM more suitable for language learning tasks. Firstly, we propose an SVM with uneven margins (SVMUM) model to deal with the problem of imbalanced training data. Secondly, SVM active learning is employed in order to alleviate the difficulty in obtaining labelled training data. The algorithms are presented and evaluated on several Information Extraction (IE) tasks, where they achieved better performance than the standard SVM and the SVM with passive learning, respectively. Moreover, by combining SVMUM with the active learning algorithm, we achieve the best reported results on the seminars and jobs corpora, which are benchmark data sets used for evaluation and comparison of machine learning algorithms for IE. In addition, we also evaluate the token based classification framework for IE with three different entity tagging schemes. In comparison to previous methods dealing with the same problems, our methods are both effective and efficient, which are valuable features for real-world applications. Due to the similarity in the formulation of the learning problem for IE and for other NLP tasks, the two techniques are likely to be beneficial in a wide range of applications. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not model agnostic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1017/S1351324908004968                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 1                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The process of generating informative annotations can be time-consuming and often requires high domain expertise. Active and semi-supervised learning methods can reduce labeling effort by either automatically expanding the training set or by selecting the most informative examples to request domain expert annotation. As most selection methods are heuristic, the performance varies widely across datasets and tasks. Bootstrapping approaches such as self-training can result in negative effects due to the addition of incorrectly pseudo-labeled instances. In this work, we take a holistic approach to label acquisition and consider the expansion of clean and pseudo-labeled subsets jointly. To address the challenge of producing high-quality pseudo-labels, we introduce a collaborative teacher-student framework, where the teacher, termed AdaReNet, learns a data-driven curriculum. Experimental results on several natural language processing (NLP) tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms baselines. © 2021 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 10.1145/3453892.3461321                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, a great deal of cyber threat intelligence come from textual sources. For analysis of cyber threat intelligence, many security analysts rely on cumbersome and time-consuming manual efforts. Cybersecurity knowledge graph plays a significant role in automatics analysis of cyber threat intelligence. As the foundation for constructing cybersecurity knowledge graph, named entity recognition (NER) is required for identifying critical threat-related elements from textual cyber threat intelligence. Recently, deep neural network-based models have attained very good results in NER. However, the performance of these models relies heavily on the amount of labeled data. Since labeled data in cybersecurity is scarce, in this paper, we propose an adversarial active learning framework to effectively select the informative samples for further annotation. In addition, leveraging the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network, we propose a novel NER model by introducing a dynamic attention mechanism into the BiLSTM-LSTM encoderdecoder. With the selected informative samples annotated, the proposed NER model is retrained. As a result, the performance of the NER model is incrementally enhanced with low labeling cost.

Most existing active learning algorithms mainly rely on an uncertainty measure derived from the probabilistic classifier for query sample selection. However, such approaches suffer from two shortcomings in the context of sequence learning including 1) cold start problem and 2) label sampling dilemma. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a deep-learning-based active learning framework to directly identify query samples from the perspective of adversarial learning. Our approach intends to offer labeling priorities for sequences whose information content are least covered by existing labeled data.

However, all of these methods that are applied to biomedical corpora use only annotated samples to maximize their performances. Thus, (1) large numbers of unannotated samples are relinquished and their values are overlooked. (2) Compared with other types of active learning (AL) algorithms, generative adversarial learning (GAN)-based AL methods have developed slowly. Furthermore, current diversity-based AL methods only compute similarities between a pair of sentences and cannot evaluate distribution similarities between groups of sentences. Annotation inconsistency is one of the significant challenges in the biomedical annotation field. Most existing methods for addressing this challenge are statistics-based or rule-based methods. (3) They require sufficient expert knowledge and complex designs. To address challenges (1), (2), and (3) simultaneously, we propose innovative algorithms. Methods: GAN is introduced in this paper, and we propose the GAN-bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field (GAN-BiLSTM-CRF) and the GAN-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers-conditional random field (GAN-BERT-CRF) models, which can be considered an NER model, an AL model, and a model identifying error labels. BiLSTM-CRF or BERT-CRF is defined as the generator and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based network is considered the discriminator. (1) The generator employs unannotated samples in addition to annotated samples to maximize NER performance. (2) The outputs of the CRF layer and the discriminator are used to select unlabeled samples for the AL task. (3) The discriminator discriminates the distribution of error labels from that of correct labels, identify error labels, and address the annotation inconsistency challenge. Results: The corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge and the Chinese CCKS-2017 Task 2 dataset are adopted for experiments. Compared to the baseline BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CRF, the GAN-BiLSTM-CRF and GAN-BERT-CRF models achieved significant improvements on the precision, recall, and F1 scores in terms of NER performance. Learning curves in AL experiments show the comparative results of the proposed models. Furthermore, the trained discriminator can identify samples with incorrect medical labels in both simulation and real-word experimental environments. Conclusion: The idea of introducing GAN contributes significant results in terms of NER, active learning, and the ability to identify incorrect annotated samples. The benefits of GAN will be further studied. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: adversial,weak supervision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103481                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 2           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In the medical domain, clinical guidelines, academic papers, Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and crawled data from the Internet contain essential information. However, those data are usually unstructured but vital to knowledge graph construction. The construction of knowledge graph using unstructured data requires a large number of medical experts to participate in annotations based on their prior experiences and knowledge. Knowledge graphs’ quality highly depends on the performances of medical named entity recognition and relation extraction that are both based on data annotation. However, faced with handling such a large amount of enormous data, manual labelling turns out to be a high labor cost task. Besides, the data is generated rapidly, requiring us to annotate and extract quickly to keep the pace with the data accumulation. Therefore, we propose a named entity recognition and relation extraction framework, AHIAP, to solve these problems mentioned above. AHIAP uses active learning method to reduce the labor cost of the annotation process while maintaining the annotation quality. There are two modules in AHIAP, an active learning module for reducing labor cost and a measurement module to control the quality. By using active learning, AHIAP only takes 200 samples to get to the accuracy of 70%, whereas the standard learning strategy takes 4000 records to get the same accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.1007/978-3-030-61951-0_7                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For a student or novice researcher in the cybersecurity domain, there is a need to design an adaptive learning strategy that can break complex tasks and concepts into simple representations. An AI-enabled automated cybersecurity education system can improve cognitive engagement and active learning. Knowledge graphs (KG) provide a visual representation in a graph that can reason and interpret from the underlying data, making them suitable for use in education and interactive learning. However, there are no publicly available datasets for the cybersecurity education domain to build such systems. The data is present as unstructured educational course material, Wiki pages, capture the flag (CTF) writeups, etc. Creating knowledge graphs from unstructured text is challenging without an ontology or annotated dataset. However, data annotation for cybersecurity needs domain experts. To address these gaps, we made three contributions in this paper. First, we propose an ontology for the cybersecurity education domain for students and novice learners. Second, we develop AISecKG, a triple dataset with cybersecurity-related entities and relations as defined by the ontology. This dataset can be used to construct knowledge graphs to teach cybersecurity and promote cognitive learning. It can also be used to build downstream applications like recommendation systems or self-learning question-answering systems for students. The dataset would also help identify malicious named entities and their probable impact. Third, using this dataset, we show a downstream application to extract custom-named entities from texts and educational material on cybersecurity. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This can occur when semantics are involved, such as when extracting information or designing visualizations. A computer currently cannot be expected to solve such problems in a completely unsupervised manner. To achieve high productivity anyway, we explicitly consider human eort as a resource. Clearly the algorithm should do as much of the work as is possible, at high quality – but crucially the algorithm should also be smart enough to see where it needs help, what it should ask the user to do, and how it takes those answers into account. This concept relates to emerging elds such as human(-based) computation and active learning, but we put the focus on the proper design and analysis of algorithms, and on the resulting dialogue between algorithm and human, which we call algorithmically-guided user interaction. As a showcase, we argue that this approach should be applied to information extraction from historical maps.

The distinctive advantages of AlpacaTag are three-fold. 1) Active intelligent recommendation: dynamically suggesting annotations and sampling the most informative unlabeled instances with a back-end active learned model; 2) Automatic crowd consolidation: enhancing real-time interannotator agreement by merging inconsistent labels from multiple annotators; 3) Real-time model deployment: users can deploy their models in downstream systems while new annotations are being made. AlpacaTag is a comprehensive solution for sequence labeling tasks, ranging from rapid tagging with recommendations powered by active learning and auto-consolidation of crowd annotations to real-time model deployment. © 2019 All rights reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Included", "Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["full text, which AL strategies are used?"], "Yoka"=>["MNLP"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Currently, the framework supports text classification, sequence tagging, and seq2seq tasks. Besides state-of-the-art query strategies, ALToolbox provides a set of tools that help to reduce computational overhead and duration of AL iterations and increase annotated data reusability. The framework aims to support data scientists and researchers by providing an easy-to-deploy GUI annotation tool directly in the Jupyter IDE and an extensible benchmark for novel AL methods. We prepare a small demonstration of ALToolbox capabilities available online.

To tackle this challenging problem, we firstly propose a joint machine extraction method based on a hybrid neural network which takes three common NLP tasks—named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE) and event extraction (EE) into consideration. Then, based on the joint model, we propose an efficient active learning algorithm to select the most beneficial sentences to be annotated for further improving the model quality in a batch mode. Experimental results show that the proposed joint framework achieves better performance than state-of-the-art information extraction approaches on standard datasets, and our active algorithm surpasses all baseline methods with just 25% of the original training data and saves more than 70% annotation costs in testing data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: multi-task AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1007/978-3-030-62008-0_6                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 1             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, very few studies have investigated AL in a real-life setting in medical domain. Methods: In this study, we developed the first AL-enabled annotation system for clinical named entity recognition (NER) with a novel AL algorithm. Besides the simulation study to evaluate the novel AL algorithm, we further conducted user studies with two nurses using this system to assess the performance of AL in real world annotation processes for building clinical NER models. Results: The simulation results show that the novel AL algorithm outperformed traditional AL algorithm and random sampling. However, the user study tells a different story that AL methods did not always perform better than random sampling for different users. Conclusions: We found that the increased information content of actively selected sentences is strongly offset by the increased time required to annotate them. Moreover, the annotation time was not considered in the querying algorithms. Our future work includes developing better AL algorithms with the estimation of annotation time and evaluating the system with larger number of users. © 2017 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1186/s12911-017-0466-9                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This paper aims to shed light on the best active learning approaches for sequence labeling tasks such as information extraction and document segmentation. We survey previously used query selection strategies for sequence models, and propose several novel algorithms to address their shortcomings. We also conduct a large-scale empirical comparison using multiple corpora, which demonstrates that our proposed methods advance the state of the art. © 2008 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 731 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 10.3115/1613715.1613855                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

AL allows to learn accurate systems with much less annotated data than what is required by pure supervised learning algorithms, hence limiting the tedious effort of annotating a large collection of data. We experimentally investigate the behavior of several AL strategies for sequence labeling tasks (in a partially-labeled scenario) tailored on Partially-Labeled Conditional Random Fields, on four sequence labeling tasks: phrase chunking, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and bioentity recognition. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: pre-tagging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.3115/v1/d14-1097                         | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning (AL) is a means to alleviate the burden of annotation. This paper addresses the problem of knowing when to stop the AL process without having the human annotator make an explicit decision on the matter. We propose and evaluate an intrinsic criterion for committee-based AL of named entity recognizers. © 2009 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.3115/1596374.1596398                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For a given supplier, there can be hundreds of thousands of image documents only some of which contain useful information. Using supervised machine learning techniques has been shown to be effective in recognising these documents for further information extraction. A well known deficiency of supervised learning approaches is that annotating sufficient documents to create an effective model requires valuable human effort. This paper first shows how to obtain a representative sample from a supplier's corpus. Given this sample of unlabelled documents an active learning approach is used to select which documents to annotate first using a normalised certainty measure derived from a soft classifier's prediction distribution. Finally the accuracy of various selection approaches using this certainty measure are compared along each iteration of the active learning cycle. The experiments show that a greedy selection method using the uncertainty measure can significantly reduce the number of annotations required for a certain accuracy. The results provide valuable information for users and more generally illustrate an effective deployment of a machine learning application. © 2020 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/3430199.3430214                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier. © 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: pre-tagging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Automatically extracting SDOH information from clinical text requires data-driven information extraction models trained on annotated corpora that are heterogeneous and frequently include critical SDOH. This work presents a new corpus with SDOH annotations, a novel active learning framework, and the first extraction results on the new corpus. The Social History Annotation Corpus (SHAC) includes 4480 social history sections with detailed annotation for 12 SDOH characterizing the status, extent, and temporal information of 18K distinct events. We introduce a novel active learning framework that selects samples for annotation using a surrogate text classification task as a proxy for a more complex event extraction task. The active learning framework successfully increases the frequency of health risk factors and improves automatic extraction of these events over undirected annotation. An event extraction model trained on SHAC achieves high extraction performance for substance use status (0.82–0.93 F1), employment status (0.81–0.86 F1), and living status type (0.81–0.93 F1) on data from three institutions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103631                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The focus of this annotation initiative is on recording the time needed for the linguistic process of named entity annotation. Annotation times are measured on two basic annotation units - sentences vs. complex noun phrases. We gathered evidence that decision times are non-uniformly distributed over the annotation units, while they do not substantially deviate among annotators. This data seems to support the hypothesis that annotation times very much depend on the inherent 'hardness' of each single annotation decision. We further show how such time-stamped information can be used for empirically grounded studies of selective sampling techniques, such as Active Learning. We directly compare Active Learning costs on the basis of token-based vs. time-based measurements. The data reveals that Active Learning keeps its competitive advantage over random sampling in both scenarios though the difference is less marked for the time metric than for the token metric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We combine the power of the two for anomaly detection in GPS data by integrating them through a visualization and human-computer interaction interface. In this paper we introduce GPSvas (GPS Visual Analytics System), a system that detects anomalies in GPS data using the approach of visual analytics: a conditional random field (CRF) model is used as the machine learning component for anomaly detection in streaming GPS traces. A visualization component and an interactive user interface are built to visualize the data stream, display significant analysis results (i.e., anomalies or uncertain predications) and hidden information extracted by the anomaly detection model, which enable human experts to observe the real-time data behavior and gain insights into the data flow. Human experts further provide guidance to the machine learning model through the interaction tools; the learning model is then incrementally improved through an active learning procedure. ©2010 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1109/VAST.2010.5652467                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A crucial issue rarely addressed, however, is when to actually stop the annotation process to profit from the savings in efforts. This question is tightly related to estimating the classifier performance after a certain amount of data has already been annotated. While learning curves are the default means to monitor the progress of the annotation process in terms of classifier performance, this requires a labeled gold standard which - in realistic annotation settings, at least - is often unavailable. We here propose a method for committee-based AL to approximate the progression of the learning curve based on the disagreement among the committee members. This method relies on a separate, unlabeled corpus and is thus well suited for situations where a labeled gold standard is not available or would be too expensive to obtain. Considering named entity recognition as a test case we provide empirical evidence that this approach works well under simulation as well as under real-world annotation conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Included", "Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In our endeavour to generate precise document-level information frames from lengthy textual records, we introduce the task of Information Aggregation or Argument Aggregation. More specifically, our aim is to filter irrelevant and redundant argument mentions that were extracted at a sentence level and render a document level information frame. Majority of the existing works have been observed to resolve related tasks of document-level event argument extraction (Yang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019) and salient entity identification (Jain et al., 2020) using supervised techniques. To remove dependency from large amounts of labeled data , we explore the task of information aggregation using weakly-supervised techniques. In particular, we present an extractive algorithm with multiple sieves which adopts active learning strategies to work efficiently in low-resource settings. For this task, we have annotated our own test dataset comprising of 131 document information frames and have released the code and dataset to further research prospects in this new domain.

Due to a lack of adequate labeled data, categorizing raw recipes found online to the appropriate food genres is a challenging task. Utilizing the knowledge of domain experts to categorize recipes could be a solution. In this study, we present a novel dataset of two million culinary recipes labeled in respective categories leveraging the knowledge of food experts and an active learning technique. So, we collect the recipes from the RecipeNLG dataset [1]. We employ three human experts whose trustworthiness score is higher than 86.667% to categorize 300K recipe by their Named Entity Recognition (NER) and assign it to one of the nine categories: bakery, drinks, non-veg, vegetables, fast food, cereals, meals, sides and fusion. Finally, we categorize the remaining 1900K recipes using Active Learning method with a blend of Query-by-Committee and Human In The Loop (HITL) approaches. There are more than two million recipes in our dataset, each of which is categorized and has a confidence score linked with it.

MCQs are effective to assess the understanding of well-defined concepts. A fraction of all the sentences of a text contain well-defined concepts or information that can be asked as a MCQ. These informative sentences are required to be identified first for preparing multiple choice questions manually or automatically. In this paper we propose a technique for automatic identification of such informative sentences that can act as the basis of MCQ. The technique is based on parse structure similarity. A reference set of parse structures is compiled with the help of existing MCQs. The parse structure of a new sentence is compared with the reference structures and if similarity is found then the sentence is considered as a potential candidate. Next a rule-based post-processing module works on these potential candidates to select the final set of informative sentences. The proposed approach is tested in sports domain, where many MCQs are easily available for preparing the reference set of structures. The quality of the system selected sentences is evaluated manually. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique is quite promising. © 2014 Knowledge Management & E-Learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most previous studies on NER have been based on supervised machine learning methods that need a large amount of human-annotated training corpus. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised NER model to minimize the time-consuming and labor-intensive task for constructing the training corpus. The proposed model generates weakly labeled training corpus using a distant supervision method. Then, it improves NER accuracy by refining the weakly labeled training corpus using a bagging-based active learning method. In the experiments, the proposed model outperformed the previous semi-supervised model. It showed F1-measure of 0.764 after 15 times of bagging-based active learning. © 2016 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: distant supervision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425938                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A named entity is often a word or expression that bears a valuable piece of information, which can be effectively employed by some major NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and text summarization. In this paper, we introduce a new model called BERT-PersNER (BERT based Persian Named Entity Recognizer), in which we have applied transfer learning and active learning approaches to NER in Persian, which is regarded as a low-resource language. Like many others, we have used Conditional Random Field for tag decoding in our proposed architecture. BERT-PersNER has outperformed two available studies in Persian NER, in most cases of our experiments using the supervised learning approach on two Persian datasets called Arman and Peyma. Besides, as the very first effort to try active learning in the Persian NER, using only 30% of Arman and 20% of Peyma, we respectively achieved 92.15%, and 92.41% performance of the mentioned supervised learning experiments. © 2021 Incoma Ltd.

The damage factors (i.e., bridge element, damage, and cause) and their complex relationships can be extracted from bridge inspection reports; however, it is not practical to manually read a considerable number of inspection documents and extract such valuable information. Although existing studies attempted to automatically analyze inspection reports, they require a large amount of human effort for data labeling and model development. To overcome the limitations, the authors propose an efficient information acquisition approach that extracts damage factors and causal relationships from bridge inspection reports. The named entity recognition (NER) model was developed based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) and was trained with the active learning method. In the experiments performed with 1,650 sentences (i.e., 1,300 for training and 350 for testing), the developed model successfully classified categories of text words (i.e., damage factors) and captured their causal relationship with 0.927 accuracy and 0.860 F1 score. Besides, the active learning method could significantly reduce the human effort required for data labeling and model development. The developed model achieved 0.778 F1 score only using 140 sentences, requiring less than an hour for manual labeling. These results meant that the model was able to successfully extract major damage factors and their cause-effect relationships from a set of text sentences with little effort. Consequently, the findings of this study can help field engineers to design, construct, and maintain bridge structures. © 2020 ASCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0001530          | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Materials and methods An iterative annotation method was proposed to train annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions, and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus. Results The syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with 47,426 tokens and 2612 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes 992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7693 relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good quality, and the system modules are effective. Discussion The annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain. However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency. Conclusions In this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain. © 2017                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.04.006                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

From experiments on a large-scale corpus, we show that significant performance enhancements can be obtained by integrating various linguistic information (such as Chinese word segmentation, semantic types, part of speech, and named entity triggers) into a basic Chinese character based model. A novel feature weighting mechanism is also employed to obtain more useful cues from most important linguistic features. Moreover, to overcome the limitation of computational resources in building a high-quality named entity recognition system from a large-scale corpus, informative samples are selected by an active learning approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-540-30211-7_10                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Seed selection refers to choosing an initial sample set to label to form an initial learning model. Sample selection refers to selecting informative samples to update the model at each iteration of the active learning process. Compared to supervised machine learning approaches, active learning offers the opportunity to build statistical classifiers with a reduced amount of training samples that require manual annotation. Reducing the manual annotation effort can support automating the clinical information extraction process. This is particularly beneficial in the clinical domain, where manual annotation is a time-consuming and costly task, as it requires extensive labor from clinical experts. Our empirical findings demonstrate that (a) using sequence representations along with the length of sequence for seed selection shows potential towards more effective initial models, and (b) using sequence representations for sample selection leads to significantly lower manual annotation efforts, with up to 3% and 6% fewer tokens and concepts requiring annotation, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art query strategies. © 2017 ASIS&T                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1002/asi.23936                           | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Challenges occur due to ambi-guity in the boundary of Chinese words and the number limitation of an-notated training data. In this paper, we propose a Bi-LSTM CRF model along with self-Taught learning, active learning, and ensemble learning to recognize clinical named entities. The results achieved on CCKS-2017 Task 2 dataset with a F1-Measure of 89.88% ranks among the top sys-tems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER,dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Consequently, it important to identify factors that may affect annotation time, such as syntactic complexity of the text- to-be-annotated and the vagaries of individual user behavior. However, limited work has been done to understand annotation of clinical text. In this study, we aimed to investigate how factors inherent to the text affect annotation time for a named entity recognition (NER) task. We recruited 9 users to annotate a clinical corpus and recorded annotation time for each sample. Then we defined a set of factors that we hypothesized might affect annotation time, and fitted them into a linear regression model to predict annotation time. The linear regression model achieved an R2 of 0.611, and revealed eight time-associated factors, including characteristics of sentences, individual users, and annotation order with implications for the practice of annotation, and the development of cost models for active learning research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, the preparation of large annotated corpora hinders the training of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. Active learning is reducing the needed manual annotation work in supervised learning task. In this work, we propose a novel clustering based active learning method for the biomedical NER task. We show that the underlying NER system using the proposed method outperforms those with other state of the art active learning methods, including density, Gibbs error and entropy based approaches, as well as the random selection. We compare variations of our proposed method and find the optimal design of the active learning method, which is to use the vector representation of named entities, and to select documents that are 'representative' and 'informative', as well as to use the Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) clustering approach. In particular, the optimal variant of the proposed method achieves a deficiency gain of 36.3% over the random selection. © 2016 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727341                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, in the medical professional field, training a high-quality named entity recognition system always requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are highly expensive to obtain. In this article, to lower the cost of data annotation and maximizing the use of unlabeled data, we propose a hybrid approach to recognizing the entities in Chinese electronic medical record, which is in combination of loss-based active learning and semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we adopted a dynamic balance strategy to dynamically balance the minimum loss predicted by a named entity recognition decoder and a loss prediction module at different stages in the process. Experimental results demonstrated our proposed framework's effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher performances than existing approaches on Chinese EMR entity recognition datasets under limited labeling resources. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Both Active Learning and Semi-supervised SVMs have recently been applied to extract PPI automatically. In this paper, we explore integrating active learning approaches to semi-supervised SVMs with a NLP-driven feature selection technique. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (a) We proposed a novel PPI extraction technique called PPISpotter by combining an active learning technique with semi-supervised SVMs to extract proteinprotein interaction. (b) We extracted a comprehensive set of features from MEDLINE records by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for SVM classifiers. (c) We conducted experiments with three different PPI corpora and showed that PPISpotter is superior to four other comparison techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure.

Active learning and self-training are two different ways to use unlabeled data. They are complement when choosing unlabeled data for further training. A new strategy based on Information Density (ID) for sample selecting in sequential labeling problem is also proposed, which is suitable for both active learning and self-training. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is chosen as the underlying model for active learning and self-training in the proposed approach due to its promising performance in many sequence labeling tasks. Experiment results show the effect of the proposed method. On Sighan bakeoff 2006 MSRA NER corpus, an F1 score of 77.4% is achieved by using only 15,000 training sentences chosen by the proposed hybrid method. © 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 10.4304/jsw.5.5.530-537                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper we extend the CW approach for sequence learning and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on four noun phrase chucking and named entity recognition tasks. We then derive few algorithmic approaches to estimate the prediction's correctness of each label in the output sequence. We show that our approach provides a reliable relative correctness information as it outperforms other alternatives in ranking label-predictions according to their error. We also show empirically that our methods output close to absolute estimation of error. Finally, we show how to use this information to improve active learning. © 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The training process of supervised deep learning model usually requires a large amount of training data with high-quality reference samples. Human production of such samples is tedious, and since inter-labeler agreement is low, very unreliable. Active learning helps assuage this problem by automatically selecting a small amount of unlabeled samples for humans to hand correct. Active learning chooses a selective set of samples to be labeled. Then the CNN is trained on the labeled data iteratively, until the expected experimental effect is achieved. We propose three sample selection methods based on certainty criterion. We also establish an enterprise announcements dataset for experiments, which contains 10410 samples totally. Our experiment results show that the amount of labeled data needed for a given extraction accuracy can be reduced by more than 45.79% compared to that without active learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-319-99501-4_29                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We refer to the former capability as corrective feedback and the latter as persistent learning. While these capabilities have a natural implementation for simple classification tasks such as spam filtering, we argue that a more careful design is required for structured classification tasks. One example of a structured classification task is information extraction, in which raw text is analyzed to automatically populate a database. In this work, we augment a probabilistic information extraction system with corrective feedback and persistent learning components to assist the user in building, correcting, and updating the extraction model. We describe methods of guiding the user to incorrect predictions, suggesting the most informative fields to correct, and incorporating corrections into the inference algorithm. We also present an active learning framework that minimizes not only how many examples a user must label, but also how difficult each example is to label. We empirically validate each of the technical components in simulation and quantify the user effort saved.

To work well, such a process must be adaptable to variations in list format, tolerant of OCR errors, and careful in its selection of human guidance. We propose ListReader, a wrapper-induction solution for information extraction that is specialized for lists in OCRed documents. ListReader can induce either a regular-expression grammar or a Hidden Markov Model. Each can infer list structure and field labels from OCR text. We decrease the cost and improve the accuracy of the induction process using semi-supervised machine learning and active learning, allowing induction of a wrapper from almost a single hand-labeled instance per field per list. After applying an induced wrapper, ListReader automatically maps the labeled text it produces to a rich variety of ontologically structured predicates. We evaluate our implementation on family history books in terms of the typical F-measure and a new metric, "Label Efficiency", which measures both extraction quality and cost in a single number. We show with statistical significance that ListReader reaches values closer to optimal levels than a state-of-the-art statistical sequence labeler.

Most approaches tacitly (and unrealistically) assume that the cost for annotating each sample is identical. This study introduces a cost-aware AL method, which simultaneously models both the annotation cost and the informativeness of the samples and evaluates both via simulation and user studies. Materials and Methods: We designed a novel, cost-aware AL algorithm (Cost-CAUSE) for annotating clinical named entities; we first utilized lexical and syntactic features to estimate annotation cost, then we incorporated this cost measure into an existing AL algorithm. Using the 2010 i2b2/VA data set, we then conducted a simulation study comparing Cost-CAUSE with noncost-aware AL methods, and a user study comparing Cost-CAUSE with passive learning. Results: Our cost model fit empirical annotation data well, and Cost-CAUSE increased the simulation area under the learning curve (ALC) scores by up to 5.6% and 4.9%, compared with random sampling and alternate AL methods. Moreover, in a user annotation task, Cost-CAUSE outperformed passive learning on the ALC score and reduced annotation time by 20.5%-30.2%. Discussion: Although AL has proven effective in simulations, our user study shows that a real-world environment is far more complex. Other factors have a noticeable effect on the AL method, such as the annotation accuracy of users, the tiredness of users, and even the physical and mental condition of users. Conclusion: Cost-CAUSE saves significant annotation cost compared to random sampling. © 2019 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1093/jamia/ocz102                        | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose ListReader which provides a way to train the structure and parameters of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) without requiring any labeled training data. The induced HMM is a wrapper|a function that hides within it the complexities of low-level processing|in ListReader's case the complexities of information extraction from OCRed historical documents. The HMM wrapper is capable of recognizing lists of records in text documents and associating subsets of identical fields across related record templates. The algorithmic training method we employ is based on a novel unsupervised active grammarinduction framework. The training produces an HMM wrapper and uses an efficient active sampling process to complete the mapping from wrapper to ontology by requesting annotations from a user for automatically-selected examples. We measure performance of the final HMM in terms of F-measure of extracted information and manual annotation cost and show that ListReader learns faster and better than a state-of-the-art baseline and an alternate version of ListReader that induces a regular-expression wrapper. © 2015 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/2809544.2809547                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To train a high-performance model for CNER, it usually requires a large number of EHRs with high-quality labels. However, labeling EHRs, especially Chinese EHRs, is time-consuming and expensive. One effective solution to this issue is active learning, where a model asks labelers to annotate data which is beneficial to model performance improvement. Conventional active learning assumes a single labeler that always replies noiseless answers to queried labels. However, in real settings, multiple labelers provide diverse quality of annotation with varied cost and labelers with low overall annotation quality can still assign correct labels for some specific instances. In this paper, we propose a Cost-Quality Adaptive Active Learning (CQAAL) approach for CNER in Chinese EHRs, which maintains a balance between the annotation quality, labeling cost and the informativeness of selected instances. Specifically, our proposed CQAAL method selects cost-effective instance-labeler pairs to achieve better annotation quality with lower cost in an adaptive manner. Computational results on the CCKS2017 dataset demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of CQAAL. © 2020 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313302              | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Further, the supervised model strongly depends on the huge training data. Active learning is a different way rather than relying on a large amount random sampling. However, random sampling constructively participates in the optimal choosing training examples. Based on different query strategies, active learning can combine with other machine learning methods to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining the accuracy. This paper proposes a new active learning strategy based on Information Density (ID) integrated with CRFs for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER). On Sighan bakeoff 2006 MSRA NER corpus, an F1 score of 77.2% is achieved by using only 10,000 labeled training sentences chosen by the proposed active learning strategy. ©2009 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346315                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It is the first of its kind for Commodity News and serves to contribute towards resource building for economic and financial text mining. This paper describes the data collection process, the annotation methodology, and the event typology used in producing the corpus. Firstly, a seed set of 175 news articles were manually annotated, of which a subset of 25 news was used as the adjudicated reference test set for inter-annotator and system evaluation. The inter-annotator agreement was generally substantial, and annotator performance was adequate, indicating that the annotation scheme produces consistent event annotations of high quality. Subsequently, the dataset is expanded through (1) data augmentation and (2) Human-in-the-loop active learning. The resulting corpus has 425 news articles with approximately 11k events annotated. As part of the active learning process, the corpus was used to train basic event extraction models for machine labeling; the resulting models also serve as a validation or as a pilot study demonstrating the use of the corpus in machine learning purposes.

Promoting these technologies will not be successful without an effective data-driven method to identify cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a data-driven model for identifying global cutting-edge science technologies based on SpaCy. In this model, we collected data released by 17 well-known American technology media websites from July 2019 to July 2020 using web crawling with Python. We combine graph-based neural network learning with active learning as the research method in this paper. Next, we introduced a ten-fold cross-check to train the model through machine learning with repeated experiments. The experimental results show that this model performed very well in entity recognition tasks with an F value of 98.11%. The model provides an information source for cutting-edge technology identification. It can promote innovations in cutting-edge technologies through its effective identification and tracking and explore more efficient scientific and technological research work modes.

However, under typical training procedures, advantages over classical methods emerge only with large datasets. As a result, deep learning is employed only when large public datasets or a large budget for manually labeling data is available. In this work, we show that by combining deep learning with active learning, we can outperform classical methods even with a significantly smaller amount of training data. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 114 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25% of the original training data. © Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Conference Track Proceedings.All right reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep active learning algorithms were designed to reduce the annotation cost for training such models. Current deep active learning algorithms, however, aim at training a good deep learning model with as little labeled data as possible, and as such are not useful in scenarios where the full dataset must be labeled. As a solution to this problem, this work investigates deep active-self learning algorithms that employ self-labeling using the trained model to help alleviate the cost of annotating full datasets for named entity recognition tasks. The experiments performed indicate that the proposed deep active-self learning algorithm is capable of reducing manual annotation costs for labeling the complete dataset for named entity recognition with less than 2% of the self labeled tokens being mislabeled. We also investigate an early stopping technique that doesn’t rely on a validation set, which effectively reduces even further the annotation costs of the proposed active-self learning algorithm in real world scenarios. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: self learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1007/978-3-030-91699-2_28                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, it typically requires a large training data set compared with statistical approaches. In areas where collecting of unlabelled data is cheap but labelling expensive, active learning can bring considerable improvement. Sequence learning algorithms require a series of token-level labels for a whole sequence to be available during the training process. Annotators of sequences typically label easily predictable parts of the sequence although such parts could be labelled automatically instead. In this paper, we introduce a combination of active and semi-supervised learning for sequence labelling. Our approach utilizes an approximation of Bayesian inference for neural nets using Monte Carlo dropout. The approximation yields a measure of uncertainty that is needed in many active learning query strategies. We propose Monte Carlo token entropy and Monte Carlo N-best sequence entropy strategies. Furthermore, we use semi-supervised pseudo-labelling to reduce labelling effort. The approach was experimentally evaluated on multiple sequence labelling tasks. The proposed query strategies outperform other existing techniques for deep neural nets. Moreover, the semi-supervised learning reduced the labelling effort by almost 80% without any incorrectly labelled samples being inserted into the training data set. © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

For identifying named entities, many methods have been developed ranging from knowledge-based methods to supervised machine learning methods. In recent years, deep learning models have achieved cutting-edge results in language processing tasks, particularly in Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER aims to locate and categorize proper names in natural language text into predefined classes such as people, organization, location names, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on existing deep learning architectures used in the CoNLL-2003 NER task. We first introduce the basic deep learning models employed in the NER task followed by reviewing the prominent deep learning NER architectures. Furthermore, the present study throws light upon top factors impacting NER performance which includes the design choices of deep-learning-based NER architecture, and the significance of incorporating character-level information, additional lexical features, external training data, etc. while training the NER model. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: survey                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1007/978-981-15-1081-6_18                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 1       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Natural language Understanding (NLU) has ubiquitous commercial application in search, conversational platforms and more. Search queries are notoriously terse, noisy and lack grammatical cues making NLU a challenging task. Multi-lingual market scalability - a highly desirable feature for global travel agent - further add complexity. In this work, we present our NLU System for such search queries in the travel domain using multi-lingual deep learning models that perform these broad tasks: intent classification, named entity recognition and linking. We propose an alternate framework that significantly improves recognition and resolution of ill-defined sparse entities. Our system also includes cross-lingual transfer learning components featuring active learning loop to scale these models to multiple languages with minimal but high quality annotation by localization experts. We explain the business problem these models address, idiosyncrasies of our data, architecture details and implementation trade-offs. © 2020 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: corpus transfer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378495           | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 1               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Automatic Information Extraction techniques play a crucial role for this task, but many ongoing production systems still require a large component of human annotation. In this work we investigate how to better take advantage of human annotations by performing active learning on multiple IE tasks concurrently, specifically Relation Extraction and Named Entity Recognition. Our proposed approach adaptively requests annotations for one task or the other depending on the current overall performance of the combined extraction. We show promising results on a small use case extracting relations expressing Adverse Drug Reactions from unannotated sentences. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

In this work, we face the task of disambiguating companies on the basis of their written names. We propose a Siamese LSTM Network approach to extract – via supervised learning – an embedding of company name strings in a (relatively) low dimensional vector space and use this representation to identify pairs of company names that actually represent the same company (i.e., the same Entity). Given that the manual labelling of string pairs is a rather onerous task, we analyse how an Active Learning approach to prioritise the samples to be labelled leads to a more efficient overall learning pipeline. The contributions of this work are: with empirical investigations on real-world industrial data, we show that our proposed Siamese Network outperforms several benchmark approaches based on standard string matching algorithms when enough labelled data are available; moreover, we show that Active Learning prioritisation is indeed helpful when labelling resources are limited, and let the learning models reach the out-of-sample performance saturation with less labelled data with respect to standard (random) data labelling approaches. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122035                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we apply active learning strategies to domain adaptation for named entity recognition systems and show that adaptive learning combining the source and target domains is more effective than nonadaptive learning directly from the target domain. Active learning aims to minimize labeling effort by selecting the most informative instances to label. We investigate several sample selection techniques such as Maximum Entropy and Smallest Margin and apply them to the ACE corpus. Our results show that the labeling cost can be reduced by over 92% without degrading the performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1007/978-3-319-48674-1_54                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

First, we suggest a set of generic scientific concepts that have been identified in a systematic annotation process. This set of concepts is utilised to annotate a corpus of scientific abstracts from 10 domains of Science, Technology and Medicine at the phrasal level in a joint effort with domain experts. The resulting dataset is used in a set of benchmark experiments to (a) provide baseline performance for this task, (b) examine the transferability of concepts between domains. Second, we present a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline. Further, we propose the active learning strategy for an optimal selection of instances from among the various domains in our data. The experimental results show that (1) a substantial agreement is achievable by non-experts after consultation with domain experts, (2) the baseline system achieves a fairly high F1 score, (3) active learning enables us to nearly halve the amount of required training data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1007/978-3-030-45439-5_17                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most previous works applied active learning on Named Entity Recognition (token-level task) similar to the text classification (sentence-level task). They failed to consider the heterogeneity of uncertainty within each sentence and required access to the entire sentence for the annotator when labelling. To overcome the mentioned limitations, in this paper, we allow the active learning algorithm to query subsequences within sentences and propose an Entity-Aware Subsequences-based Active Learning (EASAL) that utilizes an effective Head-Tail pointer to query one entity-aware subsequence for each sentence based on BERT. For other tokens outside this subsequence, we randomly select 30% of these tokens to be pseudo-labelled for training together where the model directly predicts their pseudo-labels. Experimental results on both news and biomedical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is released at https://github.com/lylylylylyly/EASAL.

Collecting such quantities of data involves significant time and cost owing to the tedious nature of collecting speech recordings and manual nature of transcribing it. For a low resourced language such as Sinhala, collecting a sufficient data set is a major problem. To address this issue we used the Active Learning technique from the Machine Learning paradigm which is applied to many tasks such as information retrieval. Our experiment using a simple Sinhala speech corpus shows that through the use of Active Learning, the amount of utterances that need to be transcribed can be reduced by some 42% to achieve the same accuracy as using the whole data set without such a strategy. This suggests that Active Learning techniques can be successfully applied to make optimal use of scarce resources for speech recognition for new languages. © 2013 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1109/ICTer.2013.6761170                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It makes more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our proposed framework is based on an ensemble approach, where Decision Tree and Memory-based Learner are used as the base learners. The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in biomedical domain.

It makes more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our proposed framework is based on an ensemble approach, where Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Field are used as the base learners. The intuition is that both learning approaches are somewhat orthogonal in their advantages, so a combination of them can yield superior results. The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian language, namely Hindi and Bengali. Results show that the proposed technique indeed improves the performance of the system. © 2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1109/EAIT.2012.6407942                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, as knowledge constantly grows and changes, it is inevitable to extend existing KGs with entities that emerged or became relevant to the scope of the KG after its creation. Research on updating KGs typically relies on extracting named entities and relations from text. However, these approaches cannot infer entities or relations that were not explicitly stated. Alternatively, embedding models exploit implicit structural regularities to predict missing relations, but cannot predict missing entities. In this article, we introduce a novel method to enrich a KG with new entities given their textual description. Our method leverages joint embedding models, hence does not require entities or relations to be named explicitly. We show that our approach can identify new concepts in a document corpus and transfer them into the KG, and we find that the performance of our method improves substantially when extended with techniques from association rule mining, text mining, and active learning. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, entities lack a unique representation and their mentions can differ greatly. These variations arise in complex ways that cannot be captured using textual similarity metrics. However, entities have underlying structures, typically shared by entities of the same entity type, that can help reason over their name variations. Discovering, learning and manipulating these structures typically requires high manual effort in the form of large amounts of labeled training data and handwritten transformation programs. In this work, we propose an active-learning based framework that drastically reduces the labeled data required to learn the structures of entities. We show that programs for mapping entity mentions to their structures can be automatically generated using human-comprehensible labels. Our experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms both handwritten programs and supervised learning models. We also demonstrate the utility of our framework in relation extraction and entity resolution tasks. © 2018 COLING 2018 - 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings.

Active learning is often used to reduce the amount of annotation effort required to obtain training data for machine learning algorithms. A key component of an active learning approach is the query strategy, which is used to iteratively select samples for annotation. Knowledge resources have been used in information extraction as a means to derive additional features for sample representation. DKI is, however, the first query strategy that exploits such resources to inform sample selection. To evaluate the merits of DKI, in particular with respect to the reduction in annotation effort that the new query strategy allows to achieve, we conduct a comprehensive empirical comparison of active learning query strategies for information extraction within the clinical domain. The clinical domain was chosen for this work because of the availability of extensive structured knowledge resources which have often been exploited for feature generation. In addition, the clinical domain offers a compelling use case for active learning because of the necessary high costs and hurdles associated with obtaining annotations in this domain. Our experimental findings demonstrated that (1) amongst existing query strategies, the ones based on the classification model's confidence are a better choice for clinical data as they perform equally well with a much lighter computational load, and (2) significant reductions in annotation effort are achievable by exploiting knowledge resources within active learning query strategies, with up to 14% less tokens and concepts to manually annotate than with state-of-the-art query strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1145/2806416.2806550                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Multiple factors drive changes in narrative structures in different languages for different media platforms. AI-based approaches can be used to extract critical information elements from text and augment human analysis and insight to facilitate transcreation. In this study, we apply self-supervised learning and active few-shot learning based on generative pretrained transformer models (e.g. GPT-N) to perform information extraction. We also used Wikifier (https://wikifier.org/ ) to annotate the related text with links to relevant Wikipedia concepts to augment human users with additional explanations. The performance statistics were collected using four news stories, and the results show that self-supervised approach is error-prone because the GPT-3 pretrained language model can generate synthetic information based on patterns learned from its huge training corpus instead of reflecting only relevant facts in the prompted text. On the other hand, active few-shot learning worked very well with 87.5% accuracy on the experimental examples. Wikifier also provides a large number of correct and useful links to named entities such as human names, locations, organizations, and concepts. Transcreators can leverage these AI tools to augment their ability to effectively perform their tasks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-031-05643-7_38                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, effectiveness and robustness of the learnt models are influenced by a number of factors. In this paper we investigate the factors that affect the effectiveness, more specifically in terms of stability and robustness, of active learning models built using conditional random fields (CRFs) for information extraction applications. Stability, defined as a small variation of performance when small variation of the training data or a small variation of the parameters occur, is a major issue for machine learning models, but even more so in the active learning framework which aims to minimise the amount of training data required. The factors we investigate are a) the choice of incremental vs. standard active learning, b) the feature set used as a representation of the text (i.e., morphological features, syntactic features, or semantic features) and c) Gaussian prior variance as one of the important CRFs parameters. Our empirical findings show that incremental learning and the Gaussian prior variance lead to more stable and robust models across iterations. Our study also demonstrates that orthographical, morphological and contextual features as a group of basic features play an important role in learning effective models across all iterations. . © 2014, Australian Computer Society, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

FAMIE is designed to address a fundamental problem in existing AL frameworks where annotators need to wait for a long time between annotation batches due to the time-consuming nature of model training and data selection at each AL iteration. This hinders the engagement, productivity, and efficiency of annotators. Based on the idea of using a small proxy network for fast data selection, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation mechanism to synchronize the proxy network with the main large model (i.e., BERT-based) to ensure the appropriateness of the selected annotation examples for the main model. Our AL framework can support multiple languages. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of FAMIE in terms of competitive performance and time efficiency for sequence labeling with AL.

In this paper, we study one important medical information extraction task called section classification. The objective of section classification is to automatically identify sections in a medical document and classify them into one of the pre-defined section types. Training section classification models typically requires large amounts of human labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. Annotating institution-specific data, however, can be both expensive and time-consuming; which poses a big hurdle for adapting a section classification model to new medical institutions. In this paper, we apply two advanced machine learning techniques, active learning and distant supervision, to reduce annotation cost and achieve fast model adaptation for automated section classification in electronic medical records. Our experiment results show that active learning reduces the annotation cost and time by more than 50%, and distant supervision can achieve good model accuracy using weakly labeled training data only. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.3233/978-1-61499-564-7-35                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The above problems mean that the manufacturing industry knowledge utilization rate is low. This paper proposes a novel Chinese fine-grained NER (named entity recognition) method based on symmetry lightweight deep multinetwork collaboration (ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF) and model transfer considering active learning (MTAL) to research fine-grained named entity recognition of a few labeled Chinese textual data types. The method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALBERT-AttBiLSTM-CRF was applied for verification in the CLUENER2020 dataset (Public dataset) to get a pretrained model; the experiments show that the model obtains an F1 score of 0.8962, which is better than the best baseline algorithm, an improvement of 9.2%. In the second stage, the pretrained model was transferred into the Manufacturing-NER dataset (our dataset), and we used the active learning strategy to optimize the model effect. The final F1 result of Manufacturing-NER was 0.8931 after the model transfer (it was higher than 0.8576 before the model transfer); so, this method represents an improvement of 3.55%. Our method effectively transfers the existing knowledge from public source data to scientific target data, solving the problem of named entity recognition with scarce labeled domain data, and proves its effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.

This makes it crucial in supporting downstream NLP tasks such as summarization, question answering and information extraction. Despite great progress in CR, our experiments have highlighted a substandard performance of the existing open-source CR tools in the clinical domain. We set out to explore some practical solutions to fine-tune their performance on clinical data. Methods: We first explored the possibility of automatically producing silver standards following the success of such an approach in other clinical NLP tasks. We designed an ensemble approach that leverages multiple models to automatically annotate co-referring mentions. Subsequently, we looked into other ways of incorporating human feedback to improve the performance of an existing neural network approach. We proposed a semi-automatic annotation process to facilitate the manual annotation process. We also compared the effectiveness of active learning relative to random sampling in an effort to further reduce the cost of manual annotation. Results: Our experiments demonstrated that the silver standard approach was ineffective in fine-tuning the CR models. Our results indicated that active learning should also be applied with caution. The semi-automatic annotation approach combined with continued training was found to be well suited for the rapid transfer of CR models under low-resource conditions. The ensemble approach demonstrated a potential to further improve accuracy by leveraging multiple fine-tuned models. Conclusion: Overall, we have effectively transferred a general CR model to a clinical domain. Our findings based on extensive experimentation have been summarized into practical suggestions for rapid transferring of CR models across different styles of clinical narratives. © 2023 The Author(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104578                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Benefiting from the fully modular architecture design, FITAnnotator provides a systematic solution for the annotation of a variety of natural language processing tasks, including classification, sequence tagging and semantic role annotation, regardless of the language. Three kinds of interfaces are developed to annotate instances, evaluate annotation quality and manage the annotation task for annotators, reviewers and managers, respectively. FITAnnotator also gives intelligent annotations by introducing task-specific assistant to support and guide the annotators based on active learning and incremental learning strategies. This assistant is able to effectively update from the annotator feedbacks and easily handle the incremental labeling scenarios. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While deep learning-based pre-trained language models help to achieve good predictive performances in NER, many domain-specific NER applications still call for a substantial amount of labeled data. Active learning (AL), a general framework for the label acquisition problem, has been used for NER tasks to minimize the annotation cost without sacrificing model performance. However, the heavily imbalanced class distribution of tokens introduces challenges in designing effective AL querying methods for NER. We propose several AL sentence query evaluation functions that pay more attention to potential positive tokens and evaluate these proposed functions with both sentence-based and token-based cost evaluation strategies. We also propose a better data-driven normalization approach to penalize sentences that are too long or too short. Our experiments on three datasets from different domains reveal that the proposed approach reduces the number of annotated tokens while achieving better or comparable prediction performance with conventional methods. © 2023 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1017/S1351324923000165                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We employ submodular active selection on a Fisher-kernel based graph over un-transcribed utterances. The selection is theoretically guaranteed to be near-optimal. Moreover, our approach is able to bootstrap without requiring any initial transcribed data, whereas traditional approaches rely heavily on the quality of an initial model trained on some labeled data. Our experiments on phone recognition show that our approach outperforms both average-case random selection and uncertainty sampling significantly.

The content of scientific articles is still underutilized. This paper constructs an intelligent platform for information extraction and knowledge mining, namely IEKM-MD. Two innovative technologies are proposed: Firstly, a phrase-level scientific entity extraction model combining neural network and active learning is designed, which can reduce the model's dependence on large-scale corpus. Secondly, a translation-based relation prediction model is provided, which improves the relation embeddings by optimizing loss function. In addition, the platform integrates the advanced entity recognition model (spaCy.NER) and the keyword extraction model (RAKE). It provides abundant services for fine-grained and multi-dimensional knowledge, including problem discovery, method recognition, relation representation and hot spot detection. We carried out the experiments in three different domains: Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology and Genetic Engineering. The average accuracies of scientific entity extraction respectively are 0.91, 0.52 and 0.76. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

Analysing and processing these images can reveal the intricate internal structures of these objects, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive studies on their morphology, evolution, and physical properties. However, varying noise levels and point-spread functions can hamper the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction from these images. To mitigate these effects, we propose a novel image restoration algorithm that connects a deep-learning-based restoration algorithm with a high-fidelity telescope simulator. During the training stage, the simulator generates images with different levels of blur and noise to train the neural network based on the quality of restored images. After training, the neural network can restore images obtained by the telescope directly, as represented by the simulator. We have tested the algorithm using real and simulated observation data and have found that it effectively enhances fine structures in blurry images and increases the quality of observation images. This algorithm can be applied to large-scale sky survey data, such as data obtained by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Euclid, and the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction, promoting advances in the field of astronomical research. © 2023 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 10.1093/mnras/stad3363                      | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

An open problem in this scenario is how to associate machine-readable licenses specifications to the data, so that automated approaches to treat such information can be fruitfully exploited to avoid data misuse. This means that we need a way to automatically extract from a natural language document specifying a certain license a machine-readable description of the terms of use and reuse identified in such license. Ontology-based Information Extraction is crucial to translate natural language documents into Linked Data. This connection supports consumers in navigating documents and semantically related data. However, the performances of automated information extraction systems are far from being perfect, and rely heavily on human intervention, either to create heuristics, to annotate examples for inferring models, or to interpret or validate patterns emerging from data. In this paper, we apply different Active Learning strategies to Information Extraction (IE) from licenses in English, with highly repetitive text, few annotated or unannotated examples available, and very fine precision needed. We show that the most popular approach to active learning, i.e., uncertainty sampling for instance selection, does not provide a good performance in this setting. We show that we can obtain a similar effect to that of density-based methods using uncertainty sampling, by just reversing the ranking criterion, and choosing the most certain instead of the most uncertain instances. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

Much of the research on ED has been based on the specifications of the 2005 ACE [Automatic Content Extraction] event task1, and the associated annotated corpus. However, as the event instances in the ACE corpus are not evenly distributed, some frequent expressions involving ACE events do not appear in the training data, adversely affecting performance. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a Pattern Expansion technique to import frequent patterns extracted from external corpora to boost ED performance. The experimental results show that our pattern-based system with the expanded patterns can achieve 70.4% (with 1.6% absolute improvement) F-measure over the baseline, an advance over current state-of-the-art systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We describe the algorithms and present experimental results showing their effectiveness. We also describe our application of active learning techniques to these learning systems. We applied certainty-based selective sampling to each system, using fairly simple notions of certainty. We show that these selective sampling techniques greatly reduce the number of annotated examples required for the systems to achieve good generalization performance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/3-540-40030-3_18                    | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The latter requires techniques for identifying and categorising fragments of text, known as named entity recognition. Methods: A publicly available corpus of PICO annotations on biomedical abstracts is used to train a named entity recognition model, which is implemented as a recurrent neural network. This model is then applied to a separate collection of abstracts for references from systematic reviews within biomedical and health domains. The occurrences of words tagged in the context of specific PICO contexts are used as additional features for a relevancy classification model. Simulations of the machine learning-assisted screening are used to evaluate the work saved by the relevancy model with and without the PICO features. Chi-squared and statistical significance of positive predicted values are used to identify words that are more indicative of relevancy within PICO contexts. Results: Inclusion of PICO features improves the performance metric on 15 of the 20 collections, with substantial gains on certain systematic reviews. Examples of words whose PICO context are more precise can explain this increase. Conclusions: Words within PICO tagged segments in abstracts are predictive features for determining inclusion. Combining PICO annotation model into the relevancy classification pipeline is a promising approach. The annotations may be useful on their own to aid users in pinpointing necessary information for data extraction, or to facilitate semantic search. © 2019 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1186/s12911-019-0992-8                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This is of great benefit as many clinical downstream tasks rely on information from unstructured clinical documents. However, for low-resource languages like German, the use of modern text processing applications that require a large amount of training data proves to be difficult, as only few data sets are available mainly due to legal restrictions. In this study, we present an information extraction framework that was initially pre-trained on real-world computed tomographic (CT) reports of head examinations, followed by domain adaptive fine-tuning on reports from different imaging examinations. We show that in the pre-training phase, the semantic and contextual meaning of one clinical reporting domain can be captured and effectively transferred to foreign clinical imaging examinations. Moreover, we introduce an active learning approach with an intrinsic strategic sampling method to generate highly informative training data with low human annotation cost. We see that the model performance can be significantly improved by an appropriate selection of the data to be annotated, without the need to train the model on a specific downstream task. With a general annotation scheme that can be used not only in the radiology field but also in a broader clinical setting, we contribute to a more consistent labeling and annotation process that also facilitates the verification and evaluation of language models in the German clinical setting. © 2023, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1038/s41598-023-29323-3                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The analysis involves the classification and annotation of radiology imaging reports to identify the components needed to complete cancer staging and recurrence extraction. Besides traditional supervised learning methods such as Conditional Random Fields and Support Vector Machines, active learning approaches are investigated to bring further improvement to the information extraction system performance. A reportability classifier, separating cancer from non-cancer reports, has achieved a performance of 97.74% sensitivity and 96.00% specificity on the held-out test set. The accuracies of Report Purpose classifier and Tumour Stream classifier are approximately 80% on 10-fold cross-validation (CV) experiments. The overall F-score of the tagging system is over 93% on 5-fold CV with approximately 487000 instances from more than 3000 reports manually annotated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.2316/P.2013.791-046                      | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The community of Information Retrieval (IR) relies on accurate and high-performance IE to be able to retrieve high quality results from massive datasets. One example of IE is to identify named entities in a text, e.g., “Barack Obama served as the president of the USA”. Here, Barack Obama and USA are named entities of types of PERSON and LOCATION, respectively. Another example is to identify sentiment expressed in a text, e.g., “This movie was awesome”. Here, the sentiment expressed is positive. Finally, identifying various linguistic aspects of a text, e.g., part of speech tags, noun phrases, dependency parses, etc., which can serve as features for additional IE tasks. This tutorial introduces participants to a) the usage of Python based, open-source tools that support IE from social media data (mainly Twitter), and b) best practices for ensuring the reproducibility of research. Participants will learn and practice various semantic and syntactic IE techniques that are commonly used for analyzing tweets. Additionally, participants will be familiarized with the landscape of publicly available tweet data, and methods for collecting and preparing them for analysis. Finally, participants will be trained to use a suite of open source tools (SAIL for active learning, TwitterNER for named entity recognition3, and SocialMediaIE for multi task learning), which utilize advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning, active learning with human-in-the-loop, multi-lingual, and multi-task learning) to perform IE on their own or existing datasets. Participants will also learn how social context can be integrated in Information Extraction systems to make them better.

One application domain of IE is Information Retrieval (IR), which relies on accurate and high-performance IE to retrieve high quality results from massive datasets. Another example of IE is to identify named entities in a text. For example, in the the sentence "Katy Perry lives in the USA", Katy Perry and USA are named entities of types of PERSON and LOCATION, respectively. Also, identify the sentiment expressed in a text is another instance of IE: in the sentence, "This movie was awesome", the expressed sentiment is positive. Finally, IE is concerned with identifying various linguistic aspects of text data, e.g., part of speech of words, noun phrases, dependency parses, etc., which can serve as features for additional IE tasks. This tutorial introduces participants to a) the usage of Python based, open-source tools that support IE from social media data (mainly Twitter), and b) best practices for ensuring the responsible use of IE and research data. Participants will learn and practice various lexical, semantic, and syntactic IE techniques that are commonly used for analyzing tweets. Participants will also be familiarized with the landscape of publicly available social media data (including popular NLP and IE benchmarks) and methods for collecting and preparing them for analysis. Furthermore, participants will be trained to use a suite of open source tools (SAIL for active learning, TwitterNER for named entity recognition, TweetNLP for transformer based NLP, and SocialMediaIE for multi task learning), which utilize advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning, active learning with human-in-the-loop, multi-lingual, and multi-task learning) to perform IE on their own or existing datasets. Participants will also learn how social contexts of text production and usage of results can be integrated into IE systems to improve these systems and to consider the role of time in improving social media IE quality. Finally, participants will learn about the governance of social media data for research purposes. The tools introduced in the tutorial will focus on the three main stages of IE, namely, collection of data (including annotation), data processing and analytics, and visualization of the extracted information.

However, despite this enormous potential, few IE systems have successfully made the transition from laboratory to commercial application. The reason may be a purely practical one - to build useable, scaleable IE systems requires bringing together a range of different technologies as well as providing clear and reproducible guidelines as to how to collectively configure and deploy those technologies. This paper is an attempt to address these issues. The paper focuses on two primary goals. Firstly, we show that an information extraction system which is used for real world applications and different domains can be built using some autonomous, corporate components (agents). Such a system has some advanced properties: clear separation to different extraction tasks and steps, portability to multiple application domain, trainability, extensibility, etc. Secondly, we show that machine learning and, in particular, learning in different ways and at different levels, can be used to build practical IE systems. We show that carefully selecting the right machine learning technique for the right task and selective sampling can be used to reduce the human effort required to annotate examples for building such systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1023/B:APIN.0000033637.51909.04          | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we present a study on Information Extraction for natural language licenses that need to be translated to RDF. The final purpose of our work is to automatically extract from a natural language document specifying a certain license a machine-readable description of the terms of use and reuse identified in such license. This task presents some peculiarities that make it specially interesting to study: highly repetitive text, few annotated or unannotated examples available, and very fine precision needed. In this paper we compare different active learning settings for this particular application. We show that the most straightforward approach to instance selection, uncertainty sampling, does not provide a good performance in this setting, performing even worse than passive learning. Density-based methods are the usual alternative to uncertainty sampling, in contexts with very few labelled instances. We show that we can obtain a similar effect to that of density-based methods using uncertainty sampling, by just reversing the ranking criterion, and choosing the most certain instead of the most uncertain instances. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1007/978-3-319-18117-2_36                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In particular, the KOS is used to develop a named entity recognition (NER) system. Design/methodology/approach: A method to improve and customize an available thesaurus by leveraging documents related to the tourism in Italy is firstly presented. Then, the obtained thesaurus is used to create an annotated NER corpus, exploiting both distant supervision, deep learning and a light human supervision. Findings: The study shows that a customized KOS can effectively support IE tasks when applied to documents belonging to the same domains and types used for its construction. Moreover, it is very useful to support and ease the annotation task using the proposed methodology, allowing to annotate a corpus with a fraction of the effort required for a manual annotation. Originality/value: The paper explores an alternative use of a KOS, proposing an innovative NER corpus annotation methodology. Moreover, the KOS and the annotated NER data set will be made publicly available. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.1108/JD-02-2023-0019                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Although there are various available security knowledge sources, they are not well-connected with each other due to their heterogeneity and unstructured descriptions. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to construct a comprehensive and reusable knowledge graph in the field of information security. Specifically, we first investigate heterogeneous security knowledge sources and establish a detailed ontology of information security, integrating various security conceptual models. Then, we train a security entity identifier based on active learning to extract security knowledge from unstructured descriptions. Such extracted knowledge is then fused to establish a comprehensive and reusable security knowledge graph based on the unified ontology. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our established knowledge graph with a set of exemplary queries and reasoning rules in the context of a real security scenario. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00103             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The number of query cycles were reduced in the resulting system and also better efficiency in query was achieved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We propose to represent monadic queries by bottom-up deterministic Node Selecting Tree Transducers (NSTTs), a particular class of tree automata that we introduce. We prove that deterministic NSTTs capture the class of queries definable in monadic second order logic (MSO) in trees, which Gottlob and Koch (2002) argue to have the right expressiveness for Web information extraction, and prove that monadic queries defined by NSTTs can be answered efficiently. We present a new polynomial time algorithm in RPNI-style that learns monadic queries defined by deterministic NSTTs from completely annotated examples, where all selected nodes are distinguished. In practice, users prefer to provide partial annotations. We propose to account for partial annotations by intelligent tree pruning heuristics. We introduce pruning NSTTs-a formalism that shares many advantages of NSTTs. This leads us to an interactive learning algorithm for monadic queries defined by pruning NSTTs, which satisfies a new formal active learning model in the style of Angluin (1987). We have implemented our interactive learning algorithm integrated it into a visually interactive Web information extraction system-called SQUIRREL-by plugging it into the Mozilla Web browser. Experiments on realistic Web documents confirm excellent quality with very few user interactions during wrapper induction. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1007/s10994-006-9613-8                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning has been shown to reduce the amount of labelled data required to train a supervised learner by selectively sampling more informative data points for human annotation. We inspect double annotation data from the same domain and quantify potential problems concerning annotators' performance. For data selectively sampled according to different selection metrics, we find lower inter-annotator agreement and higher per token annotation times. However, overall results confirm the utility of active learning. © 2005 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.3115/1706543.1706569                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This paper explores various Active Self-Learning algorithms for named entity recognition tasks. Firstly, we investigate the impact of different self-training techniques on Active Self-Learning algorithms. Secondly, we propose a novel token-level Active Self-Learning algorithm that achieves near-peak performance using fewer hand-annotated tokens compared to existing works. Through numerous experiments, we found that the sentence-level Active Self-Learning algorithm did not consistently yield significant results compared to pure active learning. However, our proposed token-level Active Self-Learning algorithm showed promising performance, training a neural model to nearly peak accuracy with fewer human-annotated tokens compared to state-of-the-art active learning baseline algorithms. The experimental results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the superior performance of the token-level Active Self-Learning algorithm © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: select subsequences,semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1007/978-3-031-45392-2_31                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 1               | 0             | 0     |

We present iSeqL, an interactive tool for the rapid construction of customized text mining models through sequence labeling. With iSeqL, analysts engage in an active learning loop, labeling text instances and iteratively assessing trained models by viewing model predictions in the context of both individual text instances and task-specific visualizations of the full dataset. To build suitable models with limited training data, iSeqL leverages transfer learning and pre-trained contextual word embeddings within a recurrent neural architecture. Through case studies and an online experiment, we demonstrate the use of iSeqL to quickly bootstrap models sufficiently accurate to perform in-depth exploratory analysis. With less than an hour of annotation effort, iSeqL users are able to generate stable outputs over custom extracted entities, including context-sensitive discovery of phrases that were never manually labeled. © ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1145/3377325.3377503                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For these reasons, healthcare professionals lose big opportunities that can arise from the analysis of this data. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reduce the manual efforts needed to annotate a biomedical named entity recognition (B-NER) corpus, exploiting both active learning and distant supervision, respectively based on deep learning models (e.g., Bi-LSTM, word2vec FastText, ELMo and BERT) and biomedical knowledge bases, in order to speed up the annotation task and limit class imbalance issues. We assessed this approach by creating an Italian-language electronic health record corpus annotated with biomedical domain entities in a small fraction of the time required for a fully manual annotation. The obtained corpus was used to train a B-NER deep neural network whose performances are comparable with the state of the art, with an F1-Score equal to 0.9661 and 0.8875 on two test sets. © 2022 by the authors.

However, NER often relies on domain-specific knowledge, being conducted manually in a time-and human-resource-intensive process. These can be reduced with statistical models performing NER automatically. The current work investigates whether Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can be efficiently trained for NER in German texts, by means of an iterative procedure combining self-learning with a manual annotation–active learning–component. The training dataset increases continuously with the iterative procedure. Whilst self-learning did not markedly improve the performance of the CRF for NER, the manual annotation of sentences with the lowest probability of correct prediction clearly improved the model F1-score and simultaneously reduced the amount of manual annotation required to train the model.

This is the case in the vast majority of the world's natural languages, where such annotated resources are not readily available. To address these problems, we propose to perform joint inference over a lightly supervised IE pipeline, where all the models are trained using either active learning or unsupervised learning. Using our approach, only 25% of the training sentences in the Chinese portion of the ACE 2005 corpus need to be annotated with entity and event mentions in order for our event coreference resolver to surpass its fully supervised counterpart in performance. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In addition to its traditional successful use in classification and regression tasks, active learning has been also applied to sequence labelling. According to the standard active learning approach, sequences for which the labelling would be the most informative should be labelled. However, labelling the entire sequence may be inefficient as for some its parts, the labels can be predicted using a model. Labelling such parts brings only a little new information. Therefore in this paper, we investigate a sequence labelling approach in which in the sequence selected for labelling, the labels of most tokens are predicted by a model and only tokens that the model can not predict with sufficient confidence are labelled. Those tokens are identified using the k-best Viterbi algorithm. © 2017 T. Šabata, T. Borovička, M.

In this paper, we propose a domain-independent semi-automatic knowledge graph learning system that can be trained with less amount of data, to identify entities and relations from a large text corpus. The system performs the following tasks to extract knowledge graph from the text: (i) Named Entity Recognition (NER), and (ii) Relation Identification (Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) and Classification). The system uses deep active learning to calculate confidence scores using maximum normalized log-probability on each prediction for both NER, and relation identification. We experimented with both LSTM and transformer based models for NER and relation identification tasks.We achieved around 88% F1 score for the NER task on OntoNotes-5.0 English data set with 40% training data set and above 83% F1 score for relation identification on TACRED dataset. The OpenRE and relation classification systems were trained on domain-specific datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a knowledge graph generation learning system with deep active learning. © 2020 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207515             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For example, some string entities that are Locations are also Attractions, some Attractions are Museums, etc. Such hierarchies are common in named entity recognition (NER), document classification, and biological sequence analysis. We present a new approach for learning hierarchically decomposable concepts. The approach learns a high-level classifier (e.g., location vs. non-location) by seperately learning multiple finer-grained classifiers (e.g., museum vs. non-museum), and then combining the results. Soliciting labels at a finer level of granularity than that of the target concept is a new approach to active learning, which we term active over-labeling. In experiments in NER and document classification tasks, we show that active over-labeling substantially improves area under the precision-recall curve when compared with standard passive or active learning. Finally, because finer-grained labels may be more expensive to obtain, we also present a cost-sensitive active learner that uses a multi-Armed bandit approach to dynamically choose the label granularity to target, and show that the bandit-based learner is robust to differences in label cost and labeling budget. © 2016 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: over-labeling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1109/ICDM.2016.165                       | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Recent data-driven AL policy learning methods are also restricted to learn from closely related domains. We introduce a new sample-efficient method that learns the AL policy directly on the target domain of interest by using wake and dream cycles. Our approach interleaves between querying the annotation of the selected datapoints to update the underlying student learner and improving AL policy using simulation where the current student learner acts as an imperfect annotator. We evaluate our method on cross-domain and cross-lingual text classification and named entity recognition tasks. Experimental results show that our dream-based AL policy training strategy is more effective than applying the pretrained policy without further fine-tuning, and better than the existing strong baseline methods that use heuristics or reinforcement learning. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: task transfer,AL strategy uses ML                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 1             | 1     |

This is usually done using heuristic selection methods, however the effectiveness of such methods is limited and moreover, the performance of heuristics varies between datasets. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel formulation by re-framing the active learning as a reinforcement learning problem and explicitly learning a data selection policy, where the policy takes the role of the active learning heuristic. Importantly, our method allows the selection policy learned using simulation on one language to be transferred to other languages. We demonstrate our method using cross-lingual named entity recognition, observing uniform improvements over traditional active learning. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 114 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: task transfer,reinforcement-learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.18653/v1/d17-1063                        | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 1             | 0     |

We introduce a method that learns an AL policy using imitation learning (IL). Our IL-based approach makes use of an efficient and effective algorithmic expert, which provides the policy learner with good actions in the encountered AL situations. The AL strategy is then learned with a feedforward network, mapping situations to most informative query datapoints. We evaluate our method on two different tasks: text classification and named entity recognition. Experimental results show that our IL-based AL strategy is more effective than strong previous methods using heuristics and reinforcement learning. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: imitation learning,reinforcement-learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 10.18653/v1/p18-1174                        | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 2           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, in real-world situations, it can be difficult to find large datasets, particularly in the biomedical field, where it is challenging to retrieve the required material from which to derive the examples to be annotated and where a domain expert is required for annotations. To address this challenge, data augmentation can be used to generate synthetic data from an existing few-shot training set. However, current methods have a tendency to generate a vast amount of noise, thus hindering performance improvements. In this work, we propose a framework to refine a policy that allows the selection of the most informative examples in an augmented pool with a Policy-based Active Learning approach that employs a deep Q-network to define the selection strategy. We experimented the proposed approach on three benchmark biomedical datasets by simulating few-shot scenarios and found it to be more effective than the selected baselines in most of the cases. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: data-augmentation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Thus, with budget constraint, it is important to judiciously select high-quality training data for labelling in order to prevent over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a learning-to-label (L2L) framework leveraging active learning and reinforcement learning to iteratively select data to label for Name Entity Recognition (NER) task. Experimental results show that our approach is more effective than strong previous methods using heuristics and reinforcement learning. With the same number of labeled data, our approach improves the accuracy of NER by 11.91%.

These first two Vs can be effectively handled by current scale-out architectures. The third V is that of variety which affects log management efforts by the lack of a common mandatory format for log files. Essentially every component can log its events differently. The way it is logged can change with every software update. This paper describes the Log Analysis Machine Learner (LAMaLearner) system. It uses a blend of different Artificial Intelligence techniques to overcome variety issues and identify relevant events within log files. LAMaLearner is able to cluster events and generate human readable representations for all events within a cluster. A human being can annotate these clusters with specific labels. After these labels exist, LAMaLearner leverages machine learning based natural language processing techniques to label events even in changing log formats. Additionally, LAMaLearner is capable of identifying previously known named entities occurring anywhere within the logged event as well identifying frequently co-occurring variables in otherwise fixed log events. In order to stay up-to-date LAMaLearner includes a continuous feedback interface that facilitates active learning. In experiments with multiple differently formatted log files, LAMaLearner was capable of reducing the labeling effort by up to three orders of magnitude. Models trained on this labeled data achieved > 93% F1 in detecting relevant event classes. This way, LAMaLearner helps log management and SIEM operations in three ways: Firstly, it creates a quick overview about the content of previously unknown log files. Secondly, it can be used to massively reduce the required manual effort in log management and SIEM operations. Thirdly, it identifies commonly co-occurring values within logs which can be used to identify otherwise unknown aspects of large log files.

It samples a small set of data to annotate actively and is widely applied in various AI tasks. It uses an iterative process, during which we utilize the current trained model to evaluate all unlabeled samples and annotate the best samples based on a specific query strategy to update the underlying model iteratively. Most existing active learning approaches rely on only the evaluation results generated by the current model and ignore the results from previous iterations. In this paper, we propose using more historical evaluation results which can provide additional information to help better select samples. First, we apply two kinds of heuristic features of the historical evaluation results, the weighted sum of and fluctuation of the historical evaluation sequence, to improve the effectiveness of sampling. Next, to use the information contained in the historical results more globally, we design a novel query strategy that learns how to select samples based on the historical sequences automatically. We also improve current state-of-the-art active learning methods by introducing historical evaluation results. Experimental results on two common NLP tasks including text classification and named entity recognition show that our methods significantly outperform current methods IEEE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1109/TKDE.2020.3045816                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It utilizes the current trained model to evaluate all unlabeled samples and annotates the best samples scored by a specific query strategy to update the underlying model iteratively. Most active learning approaches rely on only the current evaluation score but ignore the results from previous iterations. In this paper, we propose using more historical evaluation results which can provide additional information to help better select samples. First, we apply two heuristic features of the historical evaluation results, i.e. the weighted sum and the fluctuation of history sequences. Next, to make fuller use of the information contained in the historical results, we design a query strategy that learns to select samples based on the history sequence automatically. Our proposed idea is general and can be combined with both basic and state-of-the-art query strategies to achieve improvements. Experimental results show that our methods significantly promote existing methods. © 2023 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00346                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To this aim, we introduce a new active learning method for reducing the number of training samples required by the underlying NER system. Different from prior work that only focuses on training data, we define a new loss function that when estimating loss and uncertainty scores of training samples for selection, it takes also into account the uncertainty of the K unlabelled test instances most similar to the unlabelled training instances. Experimental results on both general domain and clinical benchmark datasets show that the proposed active learning method allows to train the NER system with between 5% to 7% less training data compared to state of the art uncertainty sampling methods, while retaining high NER effectiveness. © 2021 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533675             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Previous studies on NER systems generally include supervised machine-learning methods that require a substantial amount of human-annotated training corpus. In the smart home environment, categories of named entities should be defined according to voice-activated devices (e.g., food names for refrigerators and song titles for music players). The previous machine-learning methods make it difficult to change categories of named entities because a large amount of the training corpus should be newly constructed by hand. To address this problem, we present a semi-supervised NER system to minimize the time-consuming and labor-intensive task of constructing the training corpus. Our system uses distant supervision methods with two kinds of auto-labeling processes: auto-labeling based on heuristic rules for single-class named entity corpus generation and auto-labeling based on a pre-trained single-class NER model for multi-class named entity corpus generation. Then, our system improves NER accuracy by using a bagging-based active learning method. In our experiments that included a generic domain that featured 11 named entity classes and a context-specific domain about baseball that featured 21 named entity classes, our system demonstrated good performances in both domains, with F1-measures of 0.777 and 0.958, respectively. Since our system was built from a relatively small human-annotated training corpus, we believe it is a viable alternative to current NER systems in smart home environments. © 2018 by the authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: distant supervision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.3390/su10020488                          | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The shortcoming is that a large quantity of manually annotated data is usually required. Previous studies have demonstrated that active learning can considerably reduce the cost of data annotation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. In real applications, we found that existing uncertainty-based active learning strategies have two shortcomings. First, these strategies prefer to choose long sequences explicitly or implicitly, which increases the annotation burden of annotators. Second, some strategies need to revise and modify the model to generate additional information for sample selection, which increases the workload of the developer and increases the training/prediction time of the model. In this paper, we first examine traditional active learning strategies in specific cases of Word2Vec-BiLSTM-CRF and Bert-CRF that have been widely used in named entity recognition on several typical datasets. Then, we propose an uncertainty-based active learning strategy called the lowest token probability (LTP), which combines the input and output of conditional random field (CRF) to select informative instances. LTP is a simple and powerful strategy that does not favor long sequences and does not need to revise the model. We test LTP on multiple real-world datasets, the experiment results show that compared with existing state-of-the-art selection strategies, LTP can reduce about 20% annotation tokens while maintaining competitive performance on both sentence-level accuracy and entity-level F1-score. Additionally, LTP significantly outperformed all other strategies in selecting valid samples, which dramatically reduced the invalid annotation times of the labelers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1007/s11063-021-10737-x                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A significant amount of investigation has been carried out since a decade for identifying chemical named entities at morphological level. However, a barrier still remains in terms of value proposition to scientists at chemistry level. Therefore, the work described here aims to circumvent the information barrier by adaptation of a Conditional Random Fields-based approach for identifying chemical named entities at various levels namely generic chemical level, morphological level, and chemistry level. Substantial effort has been invested on generation of suitable multi-level annotated corpora. Recommended machine learning practices such as active learning-based training corpus generation and feature optimization have been systematically performed. Evaluation of system performance and benchmarking against the other state-of-the-approaches showed improved results. © 2020, IGI Global.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.4018/978-1-7998-2460-2.ch076             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, most works are limited to binary or multiclass prediction problems, thus restricting the applicability of these approaches to many complex prediction problems where active learning would be most useful. For example, machine learning techniques for natural language processing applications often require combining multiple interdependent prediction problems-generally referred to as learning in structured output spaces. In many such application domains, complexity is further managed by decomposing a complex prediction into a sequence of predictions where earlier predictions are used as input to later predictions-commonly referred to as a pipeline model. This work describes methods for extending existing margin-based active learning techniques to these two settings, thus increasing the scope of problems for which active learning can be applied. We empirically validate these proposed active learning techniques by reducing the annotated data requirements on multiple instances of synthetic data, a semantic role labeling task, and a named entity and relation extraction system. © Springer-Verlag 2010.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: multi-task AL,select subsequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1007/s13042-010-0003-y                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 1             | 0               | 1               | 0             | 0     |

SVM struct is a supervised learning algorithm that provides a flexible and effective way to solve this problem. However, a large amount of training examples is often required to train SVM struct , which can be costly for many applications that generate long and complex sequence data. This paper proposes an active learning technique to select the most informative subset of unlabeled sequences for annotation by choosing sequences that have largest uncertainty in their prediction. A unique aspect of active learning for sequence labeling is that it should take into consideration the effort spent on labeling sequences, which depends on the sequence length. A new active learning technique is proposed to use dynamic programming to identify the best subset of sequences to be annotated, taking into account both the uncertainty and labeling effort. Experiment results show that our SVM struct active learning technique can significantly reduce the number of sequences to be labeled while outperforming other existing techniques. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1007/978-3-540-70720-2_27                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep learning has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing and the self-supervised representation learning and the transfer learning have become the methods of choice in particular when the high quality annotated data are limited. Identification of medical concepts and information extraction is a challenging task, yet important ingredient for parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated format for downstream analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity recognition (NER) model for clinical natural language processing. The model is trained to recognise seven categories: drug names, route of administration, frequency, dosage, strength, form, duration. The model was first pre-trained on the task of predicting the next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text patients’ records from MIMIC-III corpora followed by fine-tuning on the named-entity recognition task. The model achieved a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 across all seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of the developed model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to secondary care mental health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of the trained NER model to CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1 = 0.762, however after fine-tuning on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a reasonable performance of F1 = 0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close similarity between the data sets and the NER tasks, it is essential to fine-tune the target domain data in order to achieve more accurate results.

NER+L is often used as a first step in deriving value from clinical text. Collecting labelled data for training models is difficult due to the need for specialist domain knowledge. MedCATTrainer offers an interactive web-interface to inspect and improve recognised entities from an underlying NER+L model via active learning. Secondary use of data for clinical research often has task and context specific criteria. MedCATTrainer provides a further interface to define and collect supervised learning training data for researcher specific use cases. Initial results suggest our approach allows for efficient and accurate collection of research use case specific training data. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, due to the particularity of the medical field, it is difficult for researchers to obtain sufficient labeled electronic medical records. Models trained using traditional supervised learning methods with insufficient data are not promising. To solve this problem, this paper proposes two weakly supervised learning methods, sampling-based active learning and parameter-based transfer learning, to achieve better performance. In sampling-based active learning, two uncertainty sampling strategies, least confidence sampling and entropy sampling, are used to select data from unlabeled dataset for retraining. In parameter-based transfer learning, the parameters of word representation layer and encoding layer in the source domain are initialized to the corresponding layer of the target domain, and the objective is to learn generalized linguistic knowledge from the source domain. Finally, we use a voting mechanism to ensemble these individual models to get better prediction results. Experiment on the CCKS2017 official test set shows that our system for MER achieves 0.8972 F1 score and gets better performance than the supervised methods, which obtains 0.8921 F1 score and proves the effectiveness of our approaches. The experimental results show that the weakly supervised learning methods proposed in this paper achieve the satisfactory performance as the supervised methods under comparable conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: weak supervision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 10.1007/s12559-022-10003-9                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We combine Semantic Web technologies with Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing with the aim of converting human-readable best evidence/ practice for COVID-19 into that which is computer-interpretable. We present the results of experiments with 1212 clinical ideas (medical terms and expressions) from two UK national healthcare services specialty guides for COVID-19 and three versions of two BMJ Best Practice documents for COVID-19. The paper seeks to recognise and categorise clinical ideas, performing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, with an ontology providing extra terms as context and describing the intended meaning of categories understandable by clinicians. The paper investigates: 1) the performance of classical NER using MetaMap versus NER with fine-tuned BERT models; 2) the integration of both NER approaches using a lightweight ontology developed in close collaboration with senior doctors; and 3) the easy interpretation by junior doctors of the main classes from the ontology once populated with NER results.

A number of learning algorithms are presented and empirically evaluated on a standard data set. We show that a supervised SVM classifier using various lexical and syntactic features can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, a variety of weakly supervised learning algorithms can be applied to take advantage of large amount of unlabeled data when labeling is expensive. Newly introduced random-subspace-based algorithms demonstrate their empirical advantage over competitors in the context of both active learning and bootstrapping. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The two measures for uncertainty and diversity were combined using the MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) method to give the sampling scores in our active learning strategy. We incorporated MMR-based active machine-learning idea into the biomedical named-entity recognition system. Our experimental results indicated that our strategies for active-learning based sample selection could significantly reduce the human effort. © 2006 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

When it comes to medical text, the annotation demands a foundation of expertise and professionalism. Existing methods utilize active learning to reduce costs in corpus annotation, as well as the multi-task learning strategy to model the correlations between different tasks. However, existing models do not take task-specific features for different tasks and diversity of query samples into account. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-task adversarial active learning model for medical named entity recognition and normalization. In our model, the adversarial learning keeps the effectiveness of multi-task learning module and active learning module. The task discriminator eliminates the influence of irregular task-specific features. And the diversity discriminator exploits the heterogeneity between samples to meet the diversity constraint.

Active learning targets to minimize the human annotation efforts by selecting examples for labeling. To maximize the contribution of the selected examples, we consider the multiple criteria: informativeness, representativeness and diversity and propose measures to quantify them. More comprehensively, we incorporate all the criteria using two selection strategies, both of which result in less labeling cost than single-criterion-based method. The results of the named entity recognition in both MUC-6 and GENIA show that the labeling cost can be reduced by at least 80% without degrading the performance. © 2021 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Conventional approaches emphasize domain-shared information extraction and domain-private information preservation, following the shared-private framework (SP models), which offers significant advantages over single-domain learning. However, the limited availability of annotated data in each domain considerably hinders the effectiveness of conventional supervised MDL approaches in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called multi-domain contrastive learning (MDCL) to alleviate the impact of insufficient annotations by capturing both semantic and structural information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Specifically, MDCL comprises two modules: inter-domain semantic alignment and intra-domain contrast. The former aims to align annotated instances of the same semantic category from distinct domains within a shared hidden space, while the latter focuses on learning a cluster structure of unlabeled instances in a private hidden space for each domain. MDCL is readily compatible with many SP models, requiring no additional model parameters and allowing for end-to-end training. Experimental results across five textual and image multi-domain datasets demonstrate that MDCL brings noticeable improvement over various SP models. Furthermore, MDCL can further be employed in multi-domain active learning (MDAL) to achieve a superior initialization, eventually leading to better overall performance. © 2023 The Authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: corpus transfer, not-reproducible, AL strategy not named                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.3233/FAIA230375                          | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 1                  | 0                  | 0             | 1               | 0               | 0             | 1     |

In the multi-task active learning (MTAL) paradigm, we select examples for several annotation tasks rather than for a single one as usually done in the context of AL. We introduce two MTAL metaprotocols, alternating selection and rank combination, and propose a method to implement them in practice. We experiment with a twotask annotation scenario that includes named entity and syntactic parse tree annotations on three different corpora. MTAL outperforms random selection and a stronger baseline, onesided example selection, in which one task is pursued using AL and the selected examples are provided also to the other task. © 2008 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: multi-task AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 1             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task Active Learning framework for Semantic Role Labeling with Entity Recognition (ER) as the auxiliary task to alleviate the need for extensive data and use additional information from ER to help SRL. We evaluate our approach on Indonesian conversational dataset. Our experiments show that multi-task active learning can outperform single-task active learning method and standard multi-task learning. According to our results, active learning is more efficient by using 12% less of training data compared to passive learning in both single-task and multi-task setting. We also introduce a new dataset for SRL in Indonesian conversational domain to encourage further research in this area. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER,dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose an active learning framework exploiting such relations among tasks. Intuitively, with task outputs coupled by constraints, active learning can utilize not only the uncertainty of the prediction in a single task but also the inconsistency of predictions across tasks. We formalize this idea as a cross-task value of information criteria, in which the reward of a labeling assignment is propagated and measured over all relevant tasks reachable through constraints. A specific example of our framework leads to the cross entropy measure on the predictions of coupled tasks, which generalizes the entropy in the classical single-task uncertain sampling. We conduct experiments on two real-world problems: web information extraction and document classification.

In this paper, we propose an active learning framework exploiting such relations among tasks. Intuitively, with task outputs coupled by constraints, active learning can utilize not only the uncertainty of the prediction in a single task but also the inconsistency of predictions across tasks. We formalize this idea as a cross-task value of information criteria, in which the reward of a labeling assignment is propagated and measured over all relevant tasks reachable through constraints. A specific example of our framework leads to the cross entropy measure on the predictions of coupled tasks, which generalizes the entropy in the classical single-task uncertain sampling. We conduct experiments on two real-world problems: web information extraction and document classification. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in actively collecting labeled examples for multiple related tasks.

One of the main problems is to label these new data for various machine learning applications correctly. The active learning approach presents a unique case of machine learning which is widely used to solve the above problem by significantly minimizing the need for labeled data. It aims to select the most appropriate samples from the unlabeled data to be correctly labeled by the oracle and is passed to train the active learner incrementally. There are several different query sampling strategies that exist using which the appropriate samples are selected. One of the main problems with the active learning approach is that it is very time-consuming. So in this research work, a new multi-core-based algorithm is proposed to speed up the active learning approach, which can utilize the complete computational resources present in the system. The experiments have been performed for the problem of named entity recognition which deals with labeling the sequences of words in an unstructured text by classifying them into pre-existing categories. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of both: the performance and execution time over three named entity recognition corpus of distinct biomedical domains. The evaluation results shows considerable improvement in terms of execution time for the proposed active learning algorithm than the existing active learning approach. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1007/s00607-021-01000-1                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Cluster membership is encoded in features that are incorporated in a discriminatively trained tagging model. Active learning is used to select training examples. We evaluate the technique for named-entity tagging. Compared with a state-of-the-art HMM-based name finder, the presented technique requires only 13% as much annotated data to achieve the same level of performance. Given a large annotated training set of 1,000,000 words, the technique achieves a 25% reduction in error over the state-of-the-art HMM trained on the same material. © 2004 HLT-NAACL 2004 - Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Main Conference.

In this paper, a modified method based on cascade conditional random field (CRF) is presented to address the challenge. First of all, we preprocessed the captured microblog text to basic corpus, then we manually built common name, toponym and organization database. A sliding window was set to extract the world feature, sentence feature and context feature of the text, then we established atomic templates and fabricated templates to train cascaded CRF model. Finally, an active learning algorithm based on minimum confidence was adopted to enhance the training effect of the model. This method has been verified in People's Daily labeled corpus and microblog corpus. Experimental data show that our method has achieved outstanding experiment effect compared with the traditional CRF method, the precision, recall and F-value are all improved. © 2018 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1109/ICALIP.2018.8455248                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Converting static embeddings of n-grams into a dataset of interlinked concepts with explicit contextual semantic dependencies provides the foundation to acquire reusable knowledge. However, the validation of this knowledge requires cross-checking with ground-truths that may be unavailable in an actionable or computable form. This paper presents a novel approach from the new field of explainable active learning that combines methods for learning static embeddings (word2vec models) with methods for learning dynamic contextual embeddings (transformer-based BERT models). We created a dataset for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (REX) for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 dataset has 2,212 associations captured by 11 word2vec models with additional examples of use from the biomedical literature. We propose interpreting the NER and REX tasks for COVID-19 as Question Answering (QA) incorporating general medical knowledge within the question, e.g. “does ‘cough’ (n-gram) belong to ‘clinical presentation/symptoms’ for COVID-19?”. We evaluated biomedical-specific pre-trained language models (BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBERT, and PubMedBERT) versus general-domain pre-trained language models (BERT, and RoBERTa) for transfer learning with COVID-19 dataset, i.e. task-specific fine-tuning considering NER as a sequence-level task. Using 2,060 QA for training (associations from 10 word2vec models) and 152 QA for validation (associations from 1 word2vec model), BERT obtained an F-measure of 87.38%, with precision = 93.75% and recall = 81.82%. SciBERT achieved the highest F-measure of 94.34%, with precision = 98.04% and recall = 90.91%. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: explainable AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 10.1007/978-3-030-91100-3_14                | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 1     |

Two different models, one using an active learning technique based on the context patterns generated from an unlabeled news corpus and the other based on the well known Support Vector Machine (SVM), have been developed. The active learning technique has been considered as the baseline system. The Manipuri news corpus has been manually annotated with the major NE tags, namely Person name, Location name, Organization name and Miscellaneous name to apply SVM. The SVM based system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of orthographic word-level features which are helpful in predicting the NE classes. In addition, lexical context patterns generated using the active learning technique have been used as the features of SVM in order to improve performance. The system has been trained and tested with 28,629 and 4,763 wordforms, respectively. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the overall average Recall, Precision and F-Score values of 93.91%, 95.32% and 94.59% respectively. © 2009 by Thoudam Doren Singh, Kishorjit Nongmeikapam, Asif Ekbal, and Sivaji Bandyopadhyay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Initially, we develop NER systems using the supervised machine learning algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each of these models makes use of the language independent features in the form of different contextual and orthographic word-level features along with the language dependent features extracted from the Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger and gazetteers. Context patterns generated from the unlabeled data using an active learning method are also used as the features in each of the classifiers. A semi-supervised method is proposed to describe the measures to automatically select effective unlabeled documents as well as sentences from the unlabeled data. Finally, the supervised models are combined together into a final system by defining appropriate weighted voting technique. Experimental results for a resource-poor language like Bengali show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the overall recall, precision and F-measure values of 93.81%, 92.18% and 92.98%, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1075/li.37.1.01ekb                       | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For temporal expressions, it relies on semi-automatically produced patterns. For person and organization names, it employs an ensemble of Support Vector Machines that scan the input text in two passes. The ensemble is trained using active learning, whereby the system itself proposes candidate training instances to be annotated by a human during training. The recognizer was evaluated on both a general collection of newspaper articles and a more focussed, in terms of topics, collection of financial articles. © World Scientific Publishing Company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1142/S0218213007003680                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of assigning labels to words in a text so that they can be sorted into categories. These state-of-the-art models achieve improved results despite limited resources, making language models increasingly valuable in a variety of NLP tasks. The Conditional Random Field and Active Learning Procedure form the basis of a novel Approach to named entity recognition discussed in this article. Following is an algorithmic description of how the AL-CRF model operates: Initially the samples are clustered with K-Means. Samples are used to train the fundamental CRF classifier, which is done by performing stratified sampling on the generated clusters. The following phase involves starting the selection process based on entropy. The training set is expanded to include examples with the greatest entropy values. The CRF classifier is then trained again using with a new training set, and the procedure is repeated. The AL's learning and selection procedure is repeatedly done until the harmonic mean stabilises and model for NER is obtained. The primary benefit of our method is that it is both more efficient and requires less manually marked training samples. Because of this, the procedure may become more reliable and cost-efficient. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Included", "Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["sounds like a hybrid strategy to me"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1109/ICECA55336.2022.10009592            | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A specialty domain corpus is smaller than a general domain corpus. Moreover, annotating a specialty domain corpus is more expensive than annotating a general corpus. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a model that uses point-wise prediction and active learning to achieve a high extraction performance even in a small annotation corpus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation of active learning. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["Cannot access fulltext"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1145/3366030.3366072                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning techniques select informative instances from the unlabeled data and add it to the training set in such a way that the overall classification performance improves. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can’t yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled documents. The strategies used often classify the instances to belong to the incorrect classes. The classifier is confused between two classes if the test instance is located near the margin. We propose two methods for active learning, and show that these techniques favorably result in the increased performance. The first approach is based on support vector machine (SVM), whereas the second one is based on an ensemble learning which utilizes the classification capabilities of two well-known classifiers, namely SVM and conditional random field. The motivation of using these classifiers is that these are orthogonal in nature, and thereby a combination of them can produce the better results. In order to show the efficacy of the proposed approach we choose a crucial problem, namely named entity recognition (NER) in three languages, namely Bengali, Hindi and English. This is also evaluated for NER in biomedical domain. Evaluation results reveal that the proposed techniques indeed show considerable performance improvements. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/s13042-014-0275-8                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this work, we show that the strategy of joint learning across multiple languages using a single model performs substantially better than the aforementioned alternatives. We also demonstrate that active learning provides additional, complementary benefits. We show that this simple approach enables the model to be data efficient by allowing it to arbitrate its annotation budget to query languages it is less certain on. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a diverse set of tasks: a classification task with 4 languages, a sequence tagging task with 4 languages and a dependency parsing task with 5 languages. Our proposed method, whilst simple, substantially outperforms the other viable alternatives for building a model in a multilingual setting under constrained budgets. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Named entity recognition is a mature field and most current approaches are based on supervised machine learning techniques. Such learning requires the presence of labeled examples on which to train; training examples are usually provided to the learner on the form of annotated corpora. Creating and annotating corpora is a tedious, meticulous and error prone process; obtaining good training examples is a hard task in itself. This paper describes the development and in-depth empirical investigation of a method, called BootMark, for bootstrapping the marking up of named entities in textual documents. Experimental results show that BootMark requires a human annotator to manually annotate fewer documents in order to produce a named entity recognizer with a given performance, than would be needed if the documents forming the basis for the recognizer were randomly drawn from the same corpus. The investigation further indicates that the primary gain obtained by BootMark compared to passive learning is in terms of higher recall. Thus, it is argued, the recognizers are suitable for use in privacy preservation applications.

The information in documents is typically in natural language, but can be organized in various layouts and formats. There have been recent spurt of interest in understanding document content with novel deep learning architectures. However, document understanding tasks need dense information annotations, which are costly to scale and generalize. Several active learning techniques have been proposed to reduce the overall budget of annotation while maintaining the performance of the underlying deep learning model. In this paper, we propose OPAD, a novel framework using reinforcement policy for active learning in content detection tasks for documents. The proposed framework learns the acquisition function to decide the samples to be selected while optimizing performance metrics that the tasks typically have. Furthermore, we extend to weak labelling scenarios to further reduce the cost of annotation significantly. We propose novel rewards to account for class imbalance and user feedback in the annotation interface, to improve the active learning method. We show superior performance of the proposed OPAD framework for active learning for various tasks related to document understanding like layout parsing, object detection and named entity recognition. Ablation studies for human feedback and class imbalance rewards are presented, along with a comparison of annotation times for different approaches. © 2022 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: multi-task AL,weak supervision,reinforcement-learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.1109/CVPRW56347.2022.00320               | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 2           | 0                  | 0                  | 1             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most past related work on extraction of missing attribute values work with a closed world assumption with the possible set of values known beforehand, or use dictionaries of values and hand-crafted features. How can we discover new attribute values that we have never seen before? Can we do this with limited human annotation or supervision? We study this problem in the context of product catalogs that often have missing values for many attributes of interest. In this work, we leverage product prole information such as titles and descriptions to discover missing values of product attributes. We develop a novel deep tagging model OpenTag for this extraction problem with the following contributions: (1) we formalize the problem as a sequence tagging task, and propose a joint model exploiting recurrent neural networks (specically, bidirectional LSTM) to capture context and semantics, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to enforce tagging consistency; (2) we develop a novel attention mechanism to provide interpretable explanation for our model's decisions; (3) we propose a novel sampling strategy exploring active learning to reduce the burden of human annotation. OpenTag does not use any dictionary or hand-crafted features as in prior works. Extensive experiments in real-life datasets in dierent domains show that OpenTag with our active learning strategy discovers new attribute values from as few as 150 annotated samples (reduction in 3.3x amount of annotation eort) with a high F-score of 83%, outperforming state-of-the-art models. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 130 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1145/3219819.3219839                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Yet, under-resourced languages, imperfect or noisily structured data, and user-specific classification tasks make it difficult to meet their needs using off-the-shelf models. Manual annotation of large corpora from scratch, meanwhile, can be prohibitively expensive. Thus, we propose an active learning solution for named entity recognition, attempting to maximize a custom model's improvement per additional unit of manual annotation. Our system robustly handles any domain or user-defined label set and requires no external resources, enabling quality named entity recognition for Humanities corpora where such resources are not available. Evaluating on typologically disparate languages and datasets, we reduce required annotation by 20-60% and greatly outperform a competitive active learning baseline. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not model agnostic,semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 1                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, in practice, annotators are not infallible, and they are likely to assign incorrect labels to some instances. Proactive learning is a generalisation of active learning that can model different kinds of annotators. Although proactive learning has been applied to certain labelling tasks, such as text classification, there is little work on its application to named entity (NE) tagging. In this paper, we propose a proactive learning method for producing NE annotated corpora, using two annotators with different levels of expertise, and who charge different amounts based on their levels of experience. To optimise both cost and annotation quality, we also propose a mechanism to present multiple sentences to annotators at each iteration. Experimental results for several corpora show that our method facilitates the construction of high-quality NE labelled datasets at minimal cost. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: proactive learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, one does not know what is the best active learning strategy before actually testing a handful of strategies on a labeled set, which might not be viable in a real world low-resource scenario. Instead, it would be desirable to dynamically obtain the results from the best strategy on a given scenario, while using as little annotated resources as possible.In this paper, we present a novel application of prediction with expert advice to combine different query strategies as experts, giving a greater weight to those which select the most useful instances. We evaluated our approach in two Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: Part-of-Speech tagging (for English) and Named Entity Recognition (for Portuguese). Results show that our solution keeps up with the results of the best strategy in each scenario, nearly reaching fully supervised performance with only half of the annotated data. © 2020 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177707              | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While research has focused on assisting new planners by creating new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that automatically learn patterns of construction activities, a common underlying challenge to these algorithms is the lack of annotated data necessary for their training and testing. Towards this goal, this paper provides a new annotation method and an AI-based tool for part-of-activity tagging, i.e., for decoding the constructional functionalities embedded in a given construction activity name such as the activity's action, object, and location. When annotating, the tool's active learning mechanism allows the tool's AI-engine to suggest the most relevant annotations to expert planners performing the task while learning from their approvals and revisions on the fly. We evaluate the applicability of this algorithm on a dataset of ~1,350 construction schedule activities, and we demonstrate that our method enables fast generation of high-quality ground truth annotations. Furthermore, we extend the tool's capability to provide sequence annotations for any text data and we make it customizable and openly available on GitHub for the benefit of the research community. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL strategy not named | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["For me that sounds more like an auto labeling approach rather an active learning approach"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 1                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Comparing with other named entity recognition methods, methods based on domain relevance measurement need the smaller training corpora and entity samples and are appropriate for recognizing narrow-domain entities, which belong to a subdivision and small semantic class. However, how to obtain the high-quality target corpus set become a key issue. This paper propose a biomedicine named entity recognition method by integrating domain contextual relevance measurement and active learning. Firstly, binding with densitybased clustering and semantic distance measurement, the representative and informative contexts are selected to construct the target corpus set by an active learning approach. Secondly, the domain contextual relevance of candidate entities is calculated by using Domain the discrimination degree and domain dependence function for recognizing the target entities. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce training time and improve the accuracy of entity recognition. © 2019 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: corpus transfer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1109/ITNEC.2019.8728991                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 1               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We introduce and compare different approaches to reduce class imbalance by design within the context of active learning (AL). Our goal is to compile more balanced data sets up front during annotation time when AL is used as a strategy to acquire training material. We situate our approach in the context of named entity recognition. Our experiments reveal that we can indeed reduce class imbalance and increase the performance of classifiers on minority classes while preserving a good overall performance in terms of macro F-score.

While established circuit synthesis methods, such as efficient enumeration strategies and genetic algorithms (GAs), are available, evaluation of candidate architectures often requires computationally-expensive simulations, limiting the scale of solvable problems. Strategies are needed to explore architecture design spaces more efficiently, reducing the number of evaluations required to obtain good solutions. Active learning is a semi-supervised machine learning technique that constructs a predictive model. Here we use active learning to interactively query architecture data as a strategy to choose which candidate architectures to evaluate in a way that accelerates effective design search. Active learning is used to iteratively improve predictive model accuracy with strategically-selected training samples. The predictive model used here is an ensemble method, known as random forest. Several query strategies are compared. A circuit synthesis problem is used to test the active learning strategy; two complete data sets for this case study are available, aiding analysis. While active learning has been used for structured outputs, such as sequence labeling task, the interface between active learning and engineering design, particularly circuit synthesis, has not been well studied. The results indicate that active learning is a promising strategy in reducing the evaluation cost for the circuit synthesis problem, and provide insight into possible next steps for this general solution approach.

This is particularly expensive to obtain for structured prediction tasks, where each training instance may have multiple, interacting labels, all of which must be correctly annotated for the instance to be of use to the learner. Traditional active learning addresses this problem by optimizing the order in which the examples are labeled to increase learning efficiency. However, this approach does not consider the difficulty of labeling each example, which can vary widely in structured prediction tasks. For example, the labeling predicted by a partially trained system may be easier to correct for some instances than for others. We propose a new active learning paradigm which reduces not only how many instances the annotator must label, but also how difficult each instance is to annotate. The system also leverages information from partially correct predictions to efficiently solicit annotations from the user. We validate this active learning framework in an interactive information extraction system, reducing the total number of annotation actions by 22%.

However, newswire data, the primary source of existing coreference data, lack the richness necessary to truly solve coreference. We present a new domain with denser references - quiz bowl questions - that is challenging and enjoyable to humans, and we use the quiz bowl community to develop a new coreference dataset, together with an annotation framework that can tag any text data with coreferences and named entities. We also successfully integrate active learning into this annotation pipeline to collect documents maximally useful to coreference models. State-of-the-art coreference systems underperform a simple classifier on our new dataset, motivating non-newswire data for future coreference research. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.3115/v1/n15-1117                         | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The model trains large-scale corpus to generate word vectors with semantic information and trains the character vectors in words through CNN to generate character vectors containing character features, the word vector and the character vectors are merged as the input of BiLSTM network. Through the BiLSTM network, the front and back texts features are fully extracted, and CRF is used to restrict the relevance of tags. In addition, this paper proposes an algorithm based on active learning. This algorithm uses the proposed model construction committee to select the samples with large amount of information to mark, which effectively reduces the amount of data annotation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1088/1742-6596/1732/1/012016             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In order to solve the problems of coarse concept granularity of event ontology knowledge in SCM cases, potential words of characters in the existing entity recognition models may not be matched or matched incorrectly, key features of entities with different lengths may interfere with each other in the expression of attention mechanism, and lack of a large number of annotation training samples, a top-down construction method of SCM event logic knowledge graph (ELKG) is proposed. Firstly, SCM event argument classes and class relations are defined, an event logic ontology model is built, and the event argument entities according to event logic ontology are labeled. Then, an active learning event argument entity recognition (EAER) model based on two-stage generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. In GAN generator, an EAER model based on binocular attention-based stacked BiLSTM with CNN (BACSBN) is proposed, which combines word-level character feature attention mechanism and n-gram pooling feature attention mechanism to improve the attention to character features of constituent words and highlight entity key information with different lengths, respectively. Two-stage GAN adversarial training and label space attention mechanism are introduced to select the correct predicted label samples for active learning training. The experimental results show that BACSBN can improve the entity recognition accuracy, and the two-stage GAN's active learning can further improve the recognition effect on the basis of full annotation sample training, and can still maintain a high accuracy in the absence of a large number of manual annotation data. Further, according to the sentence pattern and keyword matching, the matching relations of argument entities are completed, and the SCM ELKG is constructed to provide knowledge support for autonomous SCM. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1016/j.aei.2023.101921                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, such development cost claims are not normally backed up by controlled studies which show that such development cost savings actually occur. This situation in Language Engineering is contrasted with Software Engineering in general, where a lot of studies investigating system development cost have been carried out. We argue for the need of controlled studies that measure actual system development time in language engineering. To this end, we carry out an experiment in resource monitoring for an IE task: three named entity taggers for the same "surprise" domain are developed in parallel, using competing methods. Their human development time is accounted forusing a logging facility.We report development cost results for parallel implementations of a named entity tagger and present a breakdown of the development time for the three alternative methods. We are not aware of detailed previous parallel studies that detail how system development time is spent when creating a named entity tagger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 10.1145/1277741.1277905                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

These are two frequent kinds of noise that can affect the overall performance of machine learning process. The first noise is usually filtered by the proof reading process. This paper proposes an algorithm to deal with noisy training data problem, for a method we call reverse active learning to improve performance of supervised machine learning on clinical corpora. The effects of reverse active learning are shown to produce results on the i2b2 clinical corpus that are state-of-the-art of supervised learning method and offer a means of improving all processing strategies in clinical language processing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-642-35101-3_38                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, SVMs have an inability to provide an explanation, or comprehensible justification, for the solutions they reach. It has been shown that the '. black-box' nature of techniques like artificial neural networks (ANNs) is one of the main obstacles impeding their practical application. Therefore, techniques for rule extraction from ANNs, and recently from SVMs, were introduced to ameliorate this problem and aid in the explanation of their classification decisions. In this paper, we conduct a formal review of the area of rule extraction from SVMs. The review provides a historical perspective for this area of research and conceptually groups and analyzes the various techniques. In particular, we propose two alternative groupings; the first is based on the SVM (model) components utilized for rule extraction, while the second is based on the rule extraction approach. The aim is to provide a better understanding of the topic in addition to summarizing the main features of individual algorithms. The analysis is then followed by a comparative evaluation of the algorithms' salient features and relative performance as measured by a number of metrics. It is concluded that there is no one algorithm that can be favored in general. However, methods that are kernel independent, produce the most comprehensible rule set and have the highest fidelity to the SVM should be preferred. In addition, a specific method can be preferred if the context of the requirements of a specific application, so that appropriate tradeoffs may be made. The paper concludes by highlighting potential research directions such as the need for rule extraction methods in the case of SVM incremental and active learning and other application domains, where special types of SVMs are utilized. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 161 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 10.1016/j.neucom.2010.02.016                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In contrast to popular shared tasks on related problems, we try to move away from strictly academic rigor and rather model a business case. As a source for textual data we choose the corpus of Russian strategic documents, which we annotated according to our own annotation scheme. To speed up the annotation process, we exploit various active learning techniques. In total we ended up with more than two hundred annotated documents. Thus we managed to create a high-quality data set in short time. The shared task consisted of three tracks, devoted to 1) named entity recognition, 2) relation extraction and 3) joint named entity recognition and relation extraction. We provided with the annotated texts as well as a set of unannotated texts, which could of been used in any way to improve solutions. In the paper we overview and compare solutions, submitted by the shared task participants.

We propose a semi-automatic model to construct an NE dictionary from the free online resource DBpedia. The proposed model expands and purifies an NE dictionary based on an active learning technique. In the experiments, the proposed model classified 99.99% (180,008 out of 180,020 entries) of DBpedia entries into 18 NE categories with macro-averaging F1-measures of 0.6980 for 18 NE categories (0.7519 for 17 NE categories). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL,no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 10.1007/978-3-662-45402-2_10                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A fine-grained named entity recognizer (NER) is an essential module for identifying opinion targets in text messages, and a named-entity (NE) dictionary is a major resource that affects the performance of an NER. However, it is not easy to construct an NE dictionary manually, because human annotation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To reduce construction time and labor, we propose a semi-automatic system to construct an NE dictionary from the free online resource, Wikipedia. The proposed system constructs a pseudo-document for each Wikipedia NE by using an active-learning technique. It then classifies Wikipedia entries into NE classes based on similarities between the entries and pseudo-documents located in a vector space. In experiments, the proposed system classified 92.3 % of Wikipedia entries into 29 NE classes. It showed a high performance, with a macro-averaging F1-measure of 0.872 and micro-averaging F1-measure of 0.935. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/s11042-016-3445-8                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

An important text learning task in which AL is potentially useful is information extraction (IE), namely, the task of identifying within a text the expressions that instantiate a given concept. We contend that, unlike in other text learning tasks, IE is unique in that it does not make sense to rank individual items (i.e., word occurrences) for annotation, and that the minimal unit of text that is presented to the annotator should be an entire sentence. In this paper we propose a range of active learning strategies for IE that are based on ranking individual sentences, and experimentally compare them on a standard dataset for named entity extraction.

We propose a semi-supervised AL approach for sequence labeling where only highly uncertain subsequences are presented to human annotators, while all others in the selected sequences are automatically labeled. For the task of entity recognition, our experiments reveal that this approach reduces annotation efforts in terms of manually labeled tokens by up to 60% compared to the standard, fully supervised AL scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The ability to automatically extract the physical context of each point, e.g., the type, location, and relationship with other points, is the key to enabling building analytics at scale. However, this process is costly as it usually requires domain expertise with a deep understanding of the building system and its point naming scheme. In this study, we aim to reduce the human effort required for mapping sensors to their context, i.e., metadata mapping. We formulate the problem as a sequential labeling process and use the conditional random field to exploit the regular and dependent structures observed in the metadata. We develop a suite of active learning strategies to adaptively select the most informative subsequences in point names for human labeling, which significantly reduces the inputs from domain experts. We evaluated our approach on three different buildings and observed encouraging performance in metadata mapping from the proposed solution. © 2019 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/3360322.3360866                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, current active sequence labeling methods use the queried samples alone in each iteration, which is an inefficient way of leveraging human annotations. We propose a simple but effective data augmentation method to improve label efficiency of active sequence labeling. Our method, SeqMix, simply augments the queried samples by generating extra labeled sequences in each iteration. The key difficulty is to generate plausible sequences along with token-level labels. In SeqMix, we address this challenge by performing mixup for both sequences and token-level labels of the queried samples. Furthermore, we design a discriminator during sequence mixup, which judges whether the generated sequences are plausible or not. Our experiments on Named Entity Recognition and Event Detection tasks show that SeqMix can improve the standard active sequence labeling method by 2.27%-3.75% in terms of F1 scores.

However, there has been little work on stopping criteria for active learning. An operational stopping criterion is necessary to be able to use active learning in NLP applications. We investigate three different stopping criteria for active learning of named entity recognition (NER) and show that one of them, gradient-based stopping, (i) reliably stops active learning, (ii) achieves near-optimal NER performance, (iii) and needs only about 20% as much training data as exhaustive labeling. © 2008.

Consequently, the cost of the expertise needed to annotate the examples is a widespread issue. Active learning offers a framework to that issue, allowing to control the annotation cost while maximizing the classifier performance, but it relies on the key step of choosing which example will be proposed to the expert. In this paper, we examine and propose such selection strategies in the specific case of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) which are largely used in NLP. On the one hand, we propose a simple method to correct a bias of some state-of-the-art selection techniques. On the other hand, we detail an original approach to select the examples, based on the respect of proportions in the datasets. These contributions are validated over a large range of experiments implying several datasets and tasks, including named entity recognition, chunking, phonetization, word sense disambiguation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1007/978-3-319-77113-7_3                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A distinction is made between the basic information and the control data, and further between the semantic and metric domains. Interrelationships are identified between information extraction, sampling and structuring. For composite sampling for DTMs, the primary ingredient is distinct morphometric features to be extracted and sampled selectively. -from Author                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, relation extraction requires a large amount of labeled corpus, manually annotating sequences is time consuming and expensive. Therefore, efficient and economical methods for annotating sequences are required to ensure the performance of relational extraction. This paper proposes a method of subsequence and distant supervision based active learning. The method is annotated by selecting information-rich subsequences as a sampling unit instead of the full sentences in traditional active learning. Additionally, the method saves the labeled subsequence texts and their corresponding labels in a dictionary which is continuously updated and maintained, and pre-labels the unlabeled set through text matching based on the idea of distant supervision. Finally, the method combines a Chinese-RoBERTa-CRF model for relation extraction in Chinese medical texts. Experimental results test on the CMeIE dataset achieves the best performance compared to existing methods. And the best F1 value obtained between different sampling strategies is 55.96%. © 2023, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Export Date: 15 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1186/s12911-023-02127-1                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Previous works have shown that lightweight architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER) can achieve optimal performance with only 25% of the original training data. However, these methods do not exploit the sequential nature of language and the heterogeneity of uncertainty within each instance, requiring the labelling of whole sentences. Additionally, this standard method requires that the annotator has access to the full sentence when labelling. In this work, we overcome these limitations by allowing the AL algorithm to query subsequences within sentences, and propagate their labels to other sentences. We achieve highly efficient results on OntoNotes 5.0, only requiring 13% of the original training data, and CoNLL 2003, requiring only 27%. This is an improvement of 39% and 37% compared to querying full sentences. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: select subsequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 1               | 0             | 0     |

Algorithms based on closestto- hyperplane selection and query-by-committee selection are combined with methods for addressing imbalance such as positive amplification based on prevalence statistics from initial random samples. Three algorithms (ClosestPA, QBagPA, and QBoostPA) are presented and carefully evaluated on datasets for text classification and relation extraction. The ClosestPA algorithm is shown to consistently outperform the other two in a variety of ways and insights are provided as to why this is the case. © 2018 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1109/ICSC.2018.00029                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This optimization to achieve a more precise model becomes computationally difficult as the number of iterations increase. The small datasets available for training typically limit the models. Adding iterations on such sets to further optimize the model can often cause over-fitting, which generally leads to reduced performance. Therefore, the choice of convergence criteria is a critical step in robust and accurate model building. We evaluate different convergence criteria in terms of their robustness, stopping threshold selection, and independence from the training data size and entity. The underlying framework employs a limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) parameter optimization in the context of Conditional Random Fields (CRF). This paper presents a convergence criterion for robust training irrespective of semantic types and data sizes with two-orders of magnitude reduction in stopping threshold for improved model accuracy and faster convergence. Additionally, we examine convergence with active learning to further reduce the training data and training time.

We introduce the tag posterior probability as the tag confidence measure of an individual NE tag determined by the base model. Dubious tags are automatically detected as recognition errors, and regarded as targets of manual correction. Compared to entire sentence posterior probability, tag posterior probability has the advantage of minimizing system cost by focusing on those parts of the sentence that require manual correction. Using the tag confidence measure, the first technique, known as active learning, asks the editor to assign correct NE tags only to those parts that the base model could not assign tags confidently. Active learning reduces the learning cost by 66%, compared to the conventional method. As the second technique, we propose bootstrapping NER, which semi-automatically corrects dubious tags and updates its model. © 2009 ACL and AFNLP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A large number of unknown word, non-word and poor grammatical sentences made up the noise in the clinical corpus. Unknown words are usually complex medical vocabularies, misspellings, acronyms and abbreviations where unknown non-words are generally the clinical patterns including scores and measures. This noise produces obstacles in the initial lexical processing step as well as subsequent semantic analysis. Furthermore, the labelled data used to build ML models is very costly to obtain because it requires intensive clinical knowledge from the annotators. And even created by experts, the training examples usually contain errors and inconsistencies due to the variations in human annotators' attentiveness. Clinical domain also suffers from the nature of the imbalanced data distribution problem. These kinds of noise are very popular and potentially affect the overall information extraction performance but they were not carefully investigated in most presented health informatics systems. This paper introduces a general clinical data mining architecture which is potential of addressing all of these challenges using: automatic proof-reading process, trainable finite state pattern recogniser, iterative model development and active learning. The reportability classifier based on this architecture achieved 98.25% sensitivity and 96.14% specificity on an Australian cancer registry's held-out test set and up to 92% of training data provided for supervised ML was saved by active learning. © 2016 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["AL for CLS"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 10.1145/2939672.2939720                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, due to the standardization and professionalism of chemical safety analysis text, it is difficult to improve the performance of traditional models. To solve this problem, in this study, an improved method based on active learning is proposed, and three novel sampling algorithms are designed, Variation of Token Entropy (VTE), HAZOP Confusion Entropy (HCE) and Amplification of Least Confidence (ALC), which improve the ability of the model to understand HAZOP text. In this method, a part of data is used to establish the initial model. The sampling algorithm is then used to select high-quality samples from the data set. Finally, these high-quality samples are used to retrain the whole model to obtain the final model. The experimental results show that the performance of the VTE, HCE, and ALC algorithms are better than that of random sampling algorithms. In addition, compared with other methods, the performance of the traditional model is improved effectively by the method proposed in this paper, which proves that the method is reliable and advanced. © 2021 by the authors.

At present, the sharing of material databases is low, so it is not easy to obtain useful material data from public resources. Therefore, we use the text mining method to obtain valid data from the literature of hypereutectic Al-Si alloy. Natural language processing (NLP) is a commonly used text mining method. Named entity recognition (NER), as one of the main tasks of NLP, can effectively extract information from the literature. However, there is no public dataset suitable for material entities recognition (MER) research in the material field. To effectively apply named entity recognition to the material field, five types of entities are selected from the material literature in this paper, and the hypereutectic Al-Si alloy material entity dataset (HASE) is constructed by manual annotation, which includes 8,845 material entities in total. At the same time, in the field of materials with only a small amount of annotation data, the MER method combined with active learning is proposed. Combined with the characteristics of the material entity, active learning adopts automatic annotation based on dictionary and rules, CRF model, and BiGRU-CRF model. In the end, a total of 16,677 material entities were annotated. The method of combining active learning not only improves the performance of the MER model but also reduces the cost of annotation.

Over the past decade, a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars, extracting some predefined named entities, extracting users' intents for call classification, to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper, we present the SLU system of VoiceTone® (a service provided by AT&T where AT&T develops, deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination, we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data, and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance; 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data; and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes.

The objective is to further reduce the manual annotation effort while achieving higher effectiveness compared to a set of baseline features. Unsupervised features are derived from skip-gram word embeddings and a sequence representation approach. The comparative performance of unsupervised features and baseline handcrafted features in an active learning framework are investigated using a wide range of selection criteria including least confidence, information diversity, information density and diversity, and domain knowledge informativeness. Two clinical datasets are used for evaluation: the i2b2/VA 2010 NLP challenge and the ShARe/CLEF 2013 eHealth Evaluation Lab. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of effectiveness as well as annotation effort savings across both datasets. Using unsupervised features along with baseline features for sample representation lead to further savings of up to 9% and 10% of the token and concept annotation rates, respectively. © ALTA 2016 - Proc.

Using a dataset of online trolling obtained through active learning, we empirically find that troll messages are significantly associated with more abusive language (p<.001), lower cognitive complexity (p<.01), and greater targeting of named entities (p<.05) and identities (p<.05). These effects are robust to the likelihood that these messages come from bots. We then train and evaluate TrollHunter, a theory-driven and interpretable machine learning model using the derived psycholinguistic features. TrollHunter achieves 89% accuracy and F1 score in detecting trolling messages, with an average 12.25% improvement in performance when relationally modeling conversational context. Explorations of convergent and discriminant validity reveal that our measure of trolling is more closely related to non-hateful offensive speech over hate speech, aggressive over non-aggressive speech, and that Chinese state-sponsored accounts engage in higher levels of trolling than Russian state-sponsored accounts (p<.001). Finally, we apply TrollHunter in a field study to compare the media targets of trolling activity compared to bots as a reference group. Bots dominate replies to exclusive right-leaning media outlets like Breitbart and Newsmax, while trolls disproportionately target outlets with mixed partisan trust like BBC and ABC. This bifurcation suggests that not only are trolls and bots different entities, but they also have different impacts in relation to driving polarization and disinformation in society. Echoing recent calls for interdisciplinary approaches that link computational models with social theory, we conclude with implications for platform regulation and policy-making to curtail the actions of diverse agents of disinformation. © 2022 The Author(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103012                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Although the construction of knowledge graph based on deep learning has achieved great success, the construction of a largescale, high-quality, and domain-specific knowledge graph needs a manual annotation of large corpora, which means it is very difficult. To tackle this problem, we present a straightforward active learning strategy for cybersecurity entity recognition utilizing deep learning technology. BERT pre-trained model and residual dilation convolutional neural networks (RDCNN) are introduced to learn entity context features, and the conditional random field (CRF) layer is employed as a tag decoder. Then, taking advantages of the output results and distribution of cybersecurity entities, we propose an active learning strategy named TPCL that considers the uncertainty, confidence, and diversity. We evaluated TPCL on the general domain datasets and cybersecurity datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that TPCL performs better than the traditional strategies in terms of accuracy and F1. Moreover, compared with the general field, it has better performance in the cybersecurity field and is more suitable for the Chinese entity recognition task in this field. © 2021 Bo Xie et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1155/2021/6629591                        | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The naming entity recognition technology mostly adopts artificial construction rules in early, and now named entity recognition technology is mostly around neural networks, machine learning or deep learning. When LSTM models sentences it is impossible to encode information from the back to the front and there are less probabilistic annotations based on LSTM in named entity recognition. Aiming at these issues this article improves LSTM to bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) model and add a layer of Conditional Random Field (CRF) model after the Bi-LSTM model. The advent of the CRF layer allows the model to learn some constraints to avoid too many labels with a low probability. This article also improves the input features from word-level features to character-level features which breaks through the limitations of traditional word-level features. The experiments show that Bi-LSTM+CRF model and character-level features can greatly improve model performance in named entity recognition. Finally, active learning methods are proposed to achieve better performance in the case of less labeled data being trained. © VDE VERLAG GMBH - Berlin - Offenbach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This is often at the cost of lengthy wait-times for the user between each query iteration. We deal with a real-world information extraction task, extracting attribute-value pairs from product descriptions, where the learning system needs to be interactive and the users time needs to be used efficiently. The first step uses coEM with naive Bayes as the semi-supervised algorithm. This paper focuses on the second step which is an interactive active learning phase. We present an approximation to coEM with naive Bayes that can incorporate user feedback almost instantly and can use any sample-selection strategy for active learning. Our experimental results show high levels of accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster than using the standard coEM with naive Bayes, making our IE system practical by optimizing user time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-540-74958-5_68                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

As labeled text data is scarce and expensive, we follow developments in semi-supervised Natural Language Processing and implement a bootstrapping algorithm for extracting security entities and their relationships from text. The algorithm requires little input data, specifically, a few relations or patterns (heuristics for identifying relations), and incorporates an active learning component which queries the user on the most important decisions to prevent drifting from the desired relations. Preliminary testing on a small corpus shows promising results, obtaining precision of .82. © 2015 ACM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 10.1145/2746266.2746277                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

How-ever, the current construction-oriented QTO practice relies on estimators’ manual interpretation of work descriptions and manual processes to look up proper building objects for quantity calculation. Hence, this research aims to develop natural language processing (NLP) and rule-based algorithms to automate the information extraction (IE) from work descriptions for QTO in building construction. Specifically, several named entity recognition (NER) models, including Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and Bi-LSTM+CRF, were developed to identify construction activities, material, building component, product features, measurement unit, and additional information (e.g., work scope) from work descriptions. Cost items in the RSMeans database are used to evaluate the developed models in terms of F1 scores. HMM was found to achieve a 5% higher F1 score in the NER than the other three algorithms. Then, labeling rules and active learning strategies were applied along with the HMM model, which improved F1 score by 3% and reduced the labeling efforts by 26%. The results showed that the proposed IE method successfully interprets the desired information from the work description for QTO.

In recent years, named entity recognition (NER) is becoming a popular task for the public to obtain structured information from public opinion text. At present, NER models with good results, such as deep learning model, need a lot of labeled data for training. However, this will give rise to a problem: labeling a large amount of data requires a lot of human resources, which is thankless in some areas. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a NER model combining active learning and deep learning methods. Firstly, the active learning method can solve the above problem. The strategy combines uncertainty-based sampling and diversity-based sampling to estimate the information of data. We use highly informative data as the initial training dataset. Secondly, this paper uses a deep learning model combining bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers, bidirectional long–short-term memory and conditional random field (BERT-BiLSTM-CRF). BERT extracts the semantic features of data, and BiLSTM predicts the probability distribution of entity labels. We use the CRF for decoding the probability distribution into corresponding entity labels. Finally, we use the initial training dataset for training BERT-BiLSTM-CRF. This model predicts the entity labels of the unlabeled data. Then, we judge if the machine-labeled data is highly reliable and expand the highly reliable data to the initial training dataset. The updated dataset retrains the NER model, so that the trained model has higher precision than the previous model. The results show that our model performs well without a large number of labeled datasets. The model achieves a precision value of 70.31%, recall rate of 74.93% and F1 score of 72.55% in the named entity recognition task, which proves the effectiveness of our model. Besides, the F1 score of BERT-BiLSTM-CRF with uncertainty-based sampling and diversity-based sampling (UD_BBC) is higher than the BiLSTM-CRF based on maximum normalized log-probability (MNLP_BiLSTM-CRF) by 9.00%, when recognizing overall entity categories. It provides a solution to the problem of named entity recognition in educational public opinion. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105460              | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Little attention has been paid to UE in natural language processing. To fill this gap, we perform a vast empirical investigation of state-of-the-art UE methods for Transformer models on misclassification detection in named entity recognition and text classification tasks and propose two computationally efficient modifications, one of which approaches or even outperforms computationally intensive methods. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This approach selects and adds most informative instances to the training set iteratively such that the performance of learner improves with each iteration. Named entity recognition (NER) is a key task for information extraction in which entities present in sequences are labeled with correct class. The traditional query sampling strategies for the active learning only considers the final probability value of the model to select the most informative instances. In this paper, we have proposed a new active learning algorithm based on the hybrid query sampling strategy which also considers the sentence similarity along with the final probability value of the model and compared them with four other well known pool based uncertainty query sampling strategies based active learning approaches for named entity recognition (NER) i.e. least confident sampling, margin of confidence sampling, ratio of confidence sampling and entropy query sampling strategies. The experiments have been performed over three different biomedical NER datasets of different domains and a Spanish language NER dataset. We found that all the above approaches are able to reach to the performance of supervised learning based approach with much less annotated data requirement for training in comparison to that of supervised approach. The proposed active learning algorithm performs well and further reduces the annotation cost in comparison to the other sampling strategies based active algorithm in most of the cases. © 2021-IOS Press.

Active learning has been proven to be effective in reducing manual annotation efforts for supervised learning tasks where a human judge is asked to annotate the most informative examples with respect to a given model. However, in most cases reliable human judges are not available for all languages. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual unsupervised active learning paradigm (XLADA) that generates high-quality automatically annotated training data from a word-aligned parallel corpus. To evaluate our paradigm, we applied XLADA on English-French and English-Chinese bilingual corpora then we trained French and Chinese information extraction models. The experimental results show that XLADA can produce effective models without manually-annotated training data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: task transfer,corpus transfer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 1               | 0               | 1             | 0     |

However, current information extraction predominantly relies on supervised learning algorithms, presenting challenges in the field of CTI for two reasons. Firstly, the scarcity of labeled data with IOCs hampers the effectiveness of supervised learning. Secondly, existing methods struggle to extract comprehensive contextual features, posing difficulties in IOC recognition within CTI. To address these limitations and better suit the unique characteristics of CTI text, this paper introduces STIOCS, a semi-supervised framework that combines active learning and self-training for IOC extraction. STIOCS enhances IOC extraction accuracy and efficiency by leveraging limited labeled data and a rich unannotated corpus. Firstly, the Active Learning (AL) approach uses the Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to select reliable samples that can reduce noise pollution on pseudo-labeling in self-training. The extraction model integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms to extract local and sequential features from CTI text, respectively. Then, the semantic features are enhanced by using the different sizes of convolutional kernels to fuse the two types of features. Finally, the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is employed to recognize IOC entities. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method in IOC extraction, even with limited labeled data. Compared to supervised methods, our proposed method is only approximately 40% of the dataset is labeled, the F1 scores are achieved better than the existing methods and exhibit consistent performance improvements as the dataset size increases. STIOCS effectively suppresses weak label noise, reduces training costs, and enhances the recognition model's performance. It provides a cost-effective training framework for entity extraction in cyber threat intelligence. © 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: self training,semi supervised learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2023.108981           | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 2           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, they exhibit several weaknesses in practice, including (a) inability to use uncertainty sampling with black-box models, (b) lack of robustness to labeling noise, and (c) lack of transparency. In response, we propose a transparent batch active sampling framework by estimating the error decay curves of multiple feature-defined subsets of the data. Experiments on four named entity recognition (NER) tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform diversification-based methods for black-box NER taggers, and can make the sampling process more robust to labeling noise when combined with uncertainty-based methods. Furthermore, the analysis of experimental results sheds light on the weaknesses of different active sampling strategies, and when traditional uncertainty-based or diversification-based methods can be expected to work well. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 10.1007/s10994-020-05897-1                  | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We show how a 2D scatterplot populated with diverse and representative samples can yield improved models given the same time budget. We consider this for bootstrapping-based information extraction, in particular named entity classification, where human and machine jointly label data. To enable effective data annotation in a scatterplot, we have developed an embedding-based bootstrapping model that learns the distributional similarity of entities through the patterns that match them in a large data corpus, while being discriminative with respect to human-labeled and machine-promoted entities. We conducted a user study to assess the effectiveness of these different interfaces, and analyze bootstrapping performance in terms of human labeling accuracy, label quantity, and labeling consensus across multiple users. Our results suggest that supervision acquired from the scatterplot interface, despite being noisier, yields improvements in classification performance compared with the list interface, due to a larger quantity of supervision acquired. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Uncertainty-based active learning and the use of word embeddings led to very large performance improvements on small data sets for the entity categories PERSON and LOCATION. In contrast, the embedding features used were shown to be unsuitable for detecting entities belonging to the ORGANISATION category. The tool was also extended with functionality for visualising the usefulness of the active learning process and of the word embeddings used. The visualisations provided were able to indicate the performance differences between the entities, as well as differences with regards to usefulness of the embedding features. © 2020 German Society for Computational Linguistics & Language Technology.

The proposed method is based on the classifiers such as Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and has been tested for Bengali. The system makes use of the language independent features in the form of different contextual and orthographic word level features along with the language dependent features extracted from the Part of Speech (POS) tagger and gazetteers. Context patterns generated from the unlabeled data using an active learning method have been used as the features in each of the classifiers. A semi-supervised method has been used to describe the measures to automatically select effective documents and sentences from unlabeled data. Finally, the models have been combined together into a final system by weighted voting technique. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the overall Recall, Precision, and F-Score values of 93.81%, 92.18% and 92.98%, respectively.

The current state-of-the-art AL techniques exploit different query functions, which are mainly based on the evaluation of two criteria—uncertainty and diversity. Generally, the two criterions are independent of each other, and they also cannot guarantee that the new queried samples are identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) from the unknown source distribution. To solve this problem, a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the setting is derived by minimizing this upper bound to measure the discriminative information, which is connected with the uncertainty. And for the distribution match, the proposed method adopts the maximum mean discrepancy to constrain the distribution of the labeled samples and make them as similar to the overall sample distribution as possible, which helps capture the representative information of the data structure. In the proposed framework, the defining of the binary classes is generalized to a multiclass problem, in addition, the discriminative and representative information (DR) are combined together. In this way, our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. Meanwhile, the number of new queried samples is adaptive, and depends on the distribution of the labeled samples. In the experiments, we employed two benchmark remote sensing datasets—the Indian Pines and Washington DC datasets—and the results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed framework compared with the other state-of-the-art AL methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1016/j.neucom.2015.11.062                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It has been proven that neural architecture design is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. However, the design of the neural architecture heavily relies on the researchers’ prior knowledge and experience. And due to the limitations of humans’ inherent knowledge, it is difficult for people to jump out of their original thinking paradigm and design an optimal model. Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural Architecture Search ( NAS ) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work. In addition, we conduct a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison, and summary of these works. Finally, we provide some possible future research directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: survey                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/3447582                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 1       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A new method for stopping AL based on stabilizing predictions is presented that addresses these needs. Furthermore, stopping methods are required to handle a broad range of different annotation/performance tradeoff valuations. Despite this, the existing body of work is dominated by conservative methods with little (if any) attention paid to providing users with control over the behavior of stopping methods. The proposed method is shown to fill a gap in the level of aggressiveness available for stopping AL and supports providing users with control over stopping behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables; appeared in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2009), June 2009 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not model agnostic | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Not found on Scopus and ACM because Entity Recognition is mentioned only in chapter 4"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 1                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For active learning (AL) purposes, NNs are, however, less commonly used -- despite their current popularity. By using the superior text classification performance of NNs for AL, we can either increase a model's performance using the same amount of data or reduce the data and therefore the required annotation efforts while keeping the same performance. We review AL for text classification using deep neural networks (DNNs) and elaborate on two main causes which used to hinder the adoption: (a) the inability of NNs to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, on which the most commonly used query strategies rely, and (b) the challenge of training DNNs on small data. To investigate the former, we construct a taxonomy of query strategies, which distinguishes between data-based, model-based, and prediction-based instance selection, and investigate the prevalence of these classes in recent research. Moreover, we review recent NN-based advances in NLP like word embeddings or language models in the context of (D)NNs, survey the current state-of-the-art at the intersection of AL, text classification, and DNNs and relate recent advances in NLP to AL. Finally, we analyze recent work in AL for text classification, connect the respective query strategies to the taxonomy, and outline commonalities and shortcomings. As a result, we highlight gaps in current research and present open research questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: survey                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 1       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep learning has achieved success in many applications, but good-quality labeled samples are needed to construct a deep learning network. It is expensive getting good labeled samples in hyperspectral images for remote sensing applications. An active learning algorithm based on a weighted incremental dictionary learning is proposed for such applications. The proposed algorithm selects training samples that maximize two selection criteria, namely representative and uncertainty. This algorithm trains a deep network efﬁciently by actively selecting training samples at each iteration. The proposed algorithm is applied for the classiﬁcation of hyperspectral images, and compared with other classiﬁcation algorithms employing active learning. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is efﬁcient and effective in classifying hyperspectral images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2598859                 | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a very large collection (i.e. active learning). Our empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we deﬁne the problem of active learning as core-set selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms existing approaches in image classiﬁcation experiments by a large margin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Comment: ICLR 2018 Paper | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large margin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Comment: ICLR 2018 Paper | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Unfortunately, existing active learning methods for multi-class problems are inherently binary methods and do not scale up to a large number of classes. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic variant of the K-Nearest Neighbor method for classiﬁcation that can be seamlessly used for active learning in multi-class scenarios. Given some labeled training data, our method learns an accurate metric/kernel function over the input space that can be used for classiﬁcation and similarity search. Unlike existing metric/kernel learning methods, our scheme is highly scalable for classiﬁcation problems and provides a natural notion of uncertainty over class labels. Further, we use this measure of uncertainty to actively sample training examples that maximize discriminating capabilities of the model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method learns appropriate distance metrics that lead to state-of-the-art performance for object categorization problems. Furthermore, our active learning method effectively samples training examples, resulting in signiﬁcant accuracy gains over random sampling for multi-class problems involving a large number of classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While the common approach for collecting data in active learning is to select samples close to the classiﬁcation boundary, better performance can be achieved by taking into account the prior data distribution. The main contribution of the paper is a formal framework that incorporates clustering into active learning. The algorithm ﬁrst constructs a classiﬁer on the set of the cluster representatives, and then propagates the classiﬁcation decision to the other samples via a local noise model. The proposed model allows to select the most representative samples as well as to avoid repeatedly labeling samples in the same cluster. During the active learning process, the clustering is adjusted using the coarse-to-ﬁne strategy in order to balance between the advantage of large clusters and the accuracy of the data representation. The results of experiments in image databases show a better performance of our algorithm compared to the current methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1145/1015330.1015349                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

HAR using mobile- and wearablebased deep learning algorithms have been on the rise owing to the advancements in pervasive computing. However, there are two other challenges that need to be addressed: first, the deep learning model should support on-device incremental training (model updation) from real-time incoming data points to learn user behavior over time, while also being resource-friendly; second, a suitable ground truthing technique (like Active Learning) should help establish labels on-the-fly while also selecting only the most informative data points to query from an oracle. Hence, in this paper, we propose ActiveHARNet, a resource-efficient deep ensembled model which supports on-device Incremental Learning and inference, with capabilities to represent model uncertainties through approximations in Bayesian Neural Networks using dropout. This is combined with suitable acquisition functions for active learning. Empirical results on two publicly available wrist-worn HAR and fall detection datasets indicate that ActiveHARNet achieves considerable efficiency boost during inference across different users, with a substantially low number of acquired pool points (at least 60% reduction) during incremental learning on both datasets experimented with various acquisition functions, thus demonstrating deployment and Incremental Learning feasibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1145/3325413.3329790                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Existing research has mainly focused on designing 1) deep neural network models that are expressive in capturing fine-grained semantics, e.g., NTN and ConvE, but that are however less scalable; or 2) shallow models that are scalable, e.g., TransE and DistMult, yet limited in capturing expressive semantic features. In this work, we demonstrate that we can get the best of both worlds while drastically reducing the amount of data needed to train a deep network by leveraging active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1145/3308558.3313620                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In large part, these techniques solve continuous optimization problems. Recently however, discrete generative deep learning models have been successfully used to efﬁciently search high-dimensional discrete spaces. These methods work by representing discrete objects as sequences, for which powerful sequence-based deep models can be employed. Unfortunately, these techniques are signiﬁcantly hindered by the fact that these generative models often produce invalid sequences. As a step towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent validator model. Given a partial sequence, our model learns the probability of that sequence occurring as the beginning of a full valid sequence. Thus this identiﬁes valid versus invalid sequences and crucially it also provides insight about how individual sequence elements inﬂuence the validity of discrete objects. To learn this model we propose an approach inspired by seminal work in Bayesian active learning. On a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the ability of our model to distinguish valid and invalid sequences. We believe this is a key step toward learning generative models that faithfully produce valid discrete objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The goal is to minimize the number of data annotation queried from an oracle during training. Previous active learning strategies scalable for deep networks were mostly based on uncertain sample selection. In this work, we focus on examples lying close to the decision boundary. Based on theoretical works on margin theory for active learning, we know that such examples may help to considerably decrease the number of annotations. While measuring the exact distance to the decision boundaries is intractable, we propose to rely on adversarial examples. We do not consider anymore them as a threat instead we exploit the information they provide on the distribution of the input space in order to approximate the distance to decision boundaries. We demonstrate empirically that adversarial active queries yield faster convergence of CNNs trained on MNIST, the Shoe-Bag and the QuickDraw datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The design of efficient training methods that require fewer labels is an important research direction that allows more effective use of computational and human resources for labeling and training deep neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use recent advances in deep generative models, to outperform the state-of-the-art in achieving the highest classification accuracy using as few labels as possible. Unlike previous approaches, our approach uses not only labeled images to train the classifier but also unlabeled images and generated images for co-training the whole model. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in active learning on a wide range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, CelebA, and ImageNet).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, it is conceivable that a carefully selected subsample of the dataset is sufficient for training. In this paper, we propose a gradient-based importance measure that we use to empirically analyze relative importance of training images in four datasets of varying complexity. We find that in some cases, a small subsample is indeed sufficient for training. For other datasets, however, the relative differences in importance are negligible. These results have important implications for active learning on deep networks. Additionally, our analysis method can be used as a general tool to better understand diversity of training examples in datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Comment: Fixes a typo in the abstract, no other changes | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at the scale of massive modern data sets, and modiﬁcations to make them so are typically model-speciﬁc, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the data set itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms—one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm—along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-speciﬁc, we automate the construction with a random ﬁnite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic data sets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a signiﬁcant reduction in the computational cost of inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, it is very expensive to construct pixel-wise annotated images. In this work, we propose a general batch mode active learning algorithm for semantic segmentation which automatically selects important samples to be labeled for building a competitive classifier. In our approach the edge information of an image is first introduced as a new selecting clue of active learning, which can measure the essential information relevant to segmentation performance. In addition, we also incorporate the informativeness based on Query by Committee (QBC) and representativeness criteria in our algorithm. We combine three clues to select a batch of samples during each iteration. It is shown that the image edge information is significant for the active learning for semantic segmentation in the experiments. And we also demonstrate the performance of our method outperforms the state of the art active learning approaches on the datasets of CamVid, Stanford Background and PASCAL VOC 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1145/3357384.3357968                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For simple regression an optimal myopic policy is easily tractable. However, for other tasks and with more complex models, such as classiﬁcation with nonparametric models, the optimal solution is harder to compute. Current approaches make approximations to achieve tractability. We propose an approach that expresses information gain in terms of predictive entropies, and apply this method to the Gaussian Process Classiﬁer (GPC). Our approach makes minimal approximations to the full information theoretic objective. Our experimental performance compares favourably to many popular active learning algorithms, and has equal or lower computational complexity. We compare well to decision theoretic approaches also, which are privy to more information and require much more computational time. Secondly, by developing further a reformulation of binary preference learning to a classiﬁcation problem, we extend our algorithm to Gaussian Process preference learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

When the cost of acquiring labels is high, probabilistic active learning methods can be used to greedily select the most informative data points to be labeled. However, for many large-scale problems standard greedy procedures become computationally infeasible and suffer from negligible model change. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian batch active learning approach that mitigates these issues. Our approach is motivated by approximating the complete data posterior of the model parameters. While naive batch construction methods result in correlated queries, our algorithm produces diverse batches that enable efﬁcient active learning at scale. We derive interpretable closed-form solutions akin to existing active learning procedures for linear models, and generalize to arbitrary models using random projections. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of our approach on several large-scale regression and classiﬁcation tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

But labelled data is hard to collect, and in some applications larger amounts of data are not available. The problem then is how to use CNNs with small data – as CNNs overﬁt quickly. We present an efﬁcient Bayesian CNN, offering better robustness to over-ﬁtting on small data than traditional approaches. This is by placing a probability distribution over the CNN’s kernels. We approximate our model’s intractable posterior with Bernoulli variational distributions, requiring no additional model parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, ICLR format, updated with reviewer comments | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

By adding the right amount of noise to a standard stochastic gradient optimization algorithm we show that the iterates will converge to samples from the true posterior distribution as we anneal the stepsize. This seamless transition between optimization and Bayesian posterior sampling provides an inbuilt protection against overﬁtting. We also propose a practical method for Monte Carlo estimates of posterior statistics which monitors a “sampling threshold” and collects samples after it has been surpassed. We apply the method to three models: a mixture of Gaussians, logistic regression and ICA with natural gradients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no AL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 1     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Semantic segmentation is an important tool for visual scene understanding and a meaningful measure of uncertainty is essential for decision making. Our contribution is a practical system which is able to predict pixelwise class labels with a measure of model uncertainty. We achieve this by Monte Carlo sampling with dropout at test time to generate a posterior distribution of pixel class labels. In addition, we show that modelling uncertainty improves segmentation performance by 2-3% across a number of state of the art architectures such as SegNet, FCN and Dilation Network, with no additional parametrisation. We also observe a signiﬁcant improvement in performance for smaller datasets where modelling uncertainty is more effective. We benchmark Bayesian SegNet on the indoor SUN Scene Understanding and outdoor CamVid driving scenes datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Recently, researchers introduce deep learning to this area that largely improves the recognition accuracy. However, as a supervised approach, its performance relies on availability of data and labels for every registered identity. For large-scale security systems, after image acquisition, we need to check the whole dataset and manually assign labels through comparison, which is a timeconsuming task. Besides, labelling some redundant training samples contributes little to the recognition result. In this paper, we introduce an active learning framework to select the best sample set for label assignment. We regard the active learning as a binary classification task and attempt to make the labeled and unlabeled set indistinguishable. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate our model can reduce the annotation cost while achieving comparable recognition performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803135                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difﬁcult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modiﬁcation. In this paper, we develop an efﬁcient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset – both for ﬁxed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efﬁcient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and ﬁnd that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose a novel active learning (AL) framework, which is capable of building a competitive classiﬁer with optimal feature representation via a limited amount of labeled training instances in an incremental learning manner. Our approach advances the existing AL methods in two aspects. First, we incorporate deep convolutional neural networks into AL. Through the properly designed framework, the feature representation and the classiﬁer can be simultaneously updated with progressively annotated informative samples. Second, we present a cost-effective sample selection strategy to improve the classiﬁcation performance with less manual annotations. Unlike traditional methods focusing on only the uncertain samples of low prediction conﬁdence, we especially discover the large amount of high-conﬁdence samples from the unlabeled set for feature learning. Speciﬁcally, these high-conﬁdence samples are automatically selected and iteratively assigned pseudolabels. We thus call our framework cost-effective AL (CEAL) standing for the two advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CEAL framework can achieve promising results on two challenging image classiﬁcation data sets, i.e., face recognition on the cross-age celebrity face recognition data set database and object categorization on Caltech-256.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2589879                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To optimize this decision-making process, we present a batch, cost-sensitive, active learning approach that exploits structure in the unlabeled dataset, accounts for label uncertainty, and minimizes annotation costs. We ﬁrst cluster the unlabeled instances in feature space. We next introduce an uncertainty-reducing selection criterion that encourages the batch of selected instances to span multiple clusters, in addition to taking into account annotation cost. Finally, we extend this criterion to incorporate the fact that nearby astronomical objects may be observed at the same time. On two large astronomical data sets, our approach balances the trade-oﬀs among FOV, aperture, and time cost and, therefore, helps astronomers design eﬀective experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1137/1.9781611974348.54                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It is trained using a unique combination of ofﬂine two-phase supervised learning and online human-inthe-loop active learning. While most existing research proposes ofﬂine supervision or hand-crafted reward functions for online reinforcement, we devise a novel interactive learning mechanism based on hamming-diverse beam search for response generation and one-character userfeedback at each step. Experiments show that our model inherently promotes the generation of semantically relevant and interesting responses, and can be used to train agents with customized personas, moods and conversational styles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Comment: Accepted at 6th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (\*SEM) 2017 (Previously titled "Online Sequence-to-Sequence Active Learning for Open-Domain Dialogue Generation" on ArXiv) | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose a novel active learning framework to select the most informative unlabeled samples to train a deep belief network model. We introduce a loss function speciﬁc to the active learning task and train the model to minimize the loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst research effort to integrate an active learning based criterion in the loss function used to train a deep belief network. Our extensive empirical studies on a wide variety of uni-modal and multi-modal vision datasets corroborate the potential of the method for real-world image recognition applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/ICIP.2017.8297020                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25\\% of the original training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Motivated by coreset dataset compression ideas, we present a novel active learning algorithm that queries consecutive points from the pool using farthest-ﬁrst traversals in the space of neural activation over a representation layer. We show consistent and overwhelming improvement in sample complexity over passive learning (random sampling) for three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. In addition, our algorithm outperforms the traditional uncertainty sampling technique (obtained using softmax activations), and we identify cases where uncertainty sampling is only slightly better than random sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Once all other properties of a learning problem are fixed, the model is selected by grid search on a held-out validation set. This is strictly inapplicable to active learning. Within the standardized workflow, the acquisition function is chosen among available heuristics a priori, and its success is observed only after the labeling budget is already exhausted. More importantly, none of the earlier studies report a unique consistently successful acquisition heuristic to the extent to stand out as the unique best choice. We present a method to break this vicious circle by defining the acquisition function as a learning predictor and training it by reinforcement feedback collected from each labeling round. As active learning is a scarce data regime, we bootstrap from a well-known heuristic that filters the bulk of data points on which all heuristics would agree, and learn a policy to warp the top portion of this ranking in the most beneficial way for the character of a specific data distribution. Our system consists of a Bayesian neural net, the predictor, a bootstrap acquisition function, a probabilistic state definition, and another Bayesian policy network that can effectively incorporate this input distribution. We observe on three benchmark data sets that our method always manages to either invent a new superior acquisition function or to adapt itself to the a priori unknown best performing heuristic for each specific data set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Comment: Accepted at IJCAI 2019 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We are providing theoretical insights from the intuition of modeling the interactive procedure in active learning as distribution matching, by adopting the Wasserstein distance. As a consequence, we derived a new training loss from the theoretical analysis, which is decomposed into optimizing deep neural network parameters and batch query selection through alternative optimization. In addition, the loss for training a deep neural network is naturally formulated as a min-max optimization problem through leveraging the unlabeled data information. Moreover, the proposed principles also indicate an explicit uncertainty-diversity trade-off in the query batch selection. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on different benchmarks, consistently showing better empirical performances and a better time-efﬁcient query strategy compared to the baselines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Our algorithm, Batch Active learning by Diverse Gradient Embeddings (BADGE), samples groups of points that are disparate and high magnitude when represented in a hallucinated gradient space, a strategy designed to incorporate both predictive uncertainty and sample diversity into every selected batch. Crucially, BADGE trades off between uncertainty and diversity without requiring any hand-tuned hyperparameters. While other approaches sometimes succeed for particular batch sizes or architectures, BADGE consistently performs as well or better, making it a useful option for real world active learning problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While other approaches sometimes succeed for particular batch sizes or architectures, BADGE consistently performs as well or better, making it a useful option for real world active learning problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, the applicability of AL to real-world problems remains an open question. While in supervised learning, practitioners can try many different methods, evaluating each against a validation set before selecting a model, AL affords no such luxury. Over the course of one AL run, an agent annotates its dataset exhausting its labeling budget. Thus, given a new task, an active learner has no opportunity to compare models and acquisition functions. This paper provides a largescale empirical study of deep active learning, addressing multiple tasks and, for each, multiple datasets, multiple models, and a full suite of acquisition functions. We ﬁnd that across all settings, Bayesian active learning by disagreement, using uncertainty estimates provided either by Dropout or Bayes-by-Backprop significantly improves over i.i.d. baselines and usually outperforms classic uncertainty sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Comment: To be presented at EMNLP 2018 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep learning poses several difﬁculties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a signiﬁcant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We present a new method that combines active and semi-supervised deep learning to achieve high generalization performance from a deep convolutional neural network with as few known labels as possible. In a setting where a small amount of labeled data as well as a large amount of unlabeled data is available, our method ﬁrst learns the labeled data set. This initialization is followed by an expectation maximization algorithm, where further training reduces classiﬁcation entropy on the unlabeled data by targeting a low entropy ﬁt which is consistent with the labeled data. In addition the algorithm asks at a speciﬁed frequency an oracle for labels of data with entropy above a certain entropy quantile. Using this active learning component we obtain an agile labeling process that achieves high accuracy, but requires only a small amount of known labels. For the MNIST dataset we report an error rate of 2.06% using only 300 labels and 1.06% for 1,000 labels. These results are obtained without employing any special network architecture or data augmentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00031                    | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep CNNs, however, require large amounts of labeled training data to reach their full potential. In specialized domains such as healthcare, labeled data can be difﬁcult and expensive to obtain. One way to alleviate this problem is to rely on active learning, a learning technique that aims to reduce the amount of labelled data needed for a speciﬁc task while still delivering satisfactory performance. We propose a new active learning strategy designed for deep neural networks. This method improves upon the current state-of-the-art deep Bayesian active learning method, which suffers from the mode collapse problem. We correct for this deﬁciency by making use of the expressive power and statistical properties of model ensembles. Our proposed method manages to capture superior data uncertainty, which translates into improved classiﬁcation performance. We demonstrate empirically that our ensemble method yields faster convergence of CNNs trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Comment: ICLR under review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In real-world scenarios, it’s often more practical to query a batch of instances rather than a single one at each iteration. To achieve this we need to keep not only the informativeness of the instances but also their diversity. Many heuristic methods have been proposed to tackle batch mode active learning problems, however, they suffer from two limitations which if addressed would signiﬁcantly improve the query strategy. Firstly, the similarity amongst instances is simply calculated using the feature vectors rather than being jointly learned with the classiﬁcation model. This weakens the accuracy of the diversity measurement. Secondly, these methods usually exploit the decision boundary by querying the data points close to it. However, this can be inefﬁcient when the labeled set is too small to reveal the true boundary. In this paper, we address both limitations by proposing a deep neural network based algorithm. In the training phase, a pairwise deep network is not only trained to perform classiﬁcation, but also to project data points into another space, where the similarity can be more precisely measured. In the query selection phase, the learner selects a set of instances that are maximally uncertain and minimally redundant (exploitation), as well as are most diverse from the labeled instances (exploration). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a variety of classiﬁcation tasks: MNIST classiﬁcation, opinion polarity detection and heart failure prediction. Our method outperforms the baselines with both higher classiﬁcation accuracy and faster convergence rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/ICDM.2017.67                        | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The method, Discriminative Active Learning (DAL), poses active learning as a binary classiﬁcation task, attempting to choose examples to label in such a way as to make the labeled set and the unlabeled pool indistinguishable. Experimenting on image classiﬁcation tasks, we empirically show our method to be on par with state of the art methods in medium and large query batch sizes, while being simple to implement and also extend to other domains besides classiﬁcation tasks. Our experiments also show that none of the state of the art methods of today are clearly better than uncertainty sampling when the batch size is relatively large, negating some of the reported results in the recent literature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We approach it by leveraging Active Learning, through sequential selection of examples which benefit the model most. Selecting examples one by one is not practical for the amount of training examples required by the modern Deep Learning models. We consider the mini-batch Active Learning setting, where several examples are selected at once. We present an approach which takes into account both informativeness of the examples for the model, as well as the diversity of the examples in a mini-batch. By using the well studied K-means clustering algorithm, this approach scales better than the previously proposed approaches, and achieves comparable or better performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However such tools for regression and classiﬁcation do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacriﬁcing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classiﬁcation, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and ﬁnish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, overﬁtting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it diﬃcult to deal with overﬁtting by combining the predictions of many diﬀerent large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of diﬀerent “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the eﬀect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This signiﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classiﬁcation and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Different from regular active learning, the resulting algorithm adaptively synthesizes training instances for querying to increase learning speed. We generate queries according to the uncertainty principle, but our idea can work with other active learning principles. We report results from various numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness the proposed approach. In some settings, the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional pool-based approaches. To the best our knowledge, this is the first active learning work using GAN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Different strategies in the ﬁeld of support vector machines have been proposed that iteratively select a single new example from a set of unlabelled examples, query the corresponding class label and then perform retraining of the current classiﬁer. However, to reduce computational time for training, it might be necessary to select batches of new training examples instead of single examples. Strategies for single examples can be extended straightforwardly to select batches by choosing the h > 1 examples that get the highest values for the individual selection criterion. We present a new approach that is especially designed to construct batches and incorporates a diversity measure. It has low computational requirements making it feasible for large scale problems with several thousands of examples. Experimental results indicate that this approach provides a faster method to attain a level of generalization accuracy in terms of the number of labelled examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning using uncertainty estimates from Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) could provide an effective solution to this. Despite being theoretically principled, BNNs require approximations to be applied to large-scale problems, where both performance and uncertainty estimation are crucial. In this paper, we introduce Deep Probabilistic Ensembles (DPEs), a scalable technique that uses a regularized ensemble to approximate a deep BNN. We conduct a series of large-scale visual active learning experiments to evaluate DPEs on classiﬁcation with the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, and semantic segmentation with the BDD100k dataset. Our models require signiﬁcantly less training data to achieve competitive performances, and steadily improve upon strong active learning baselines as the annotation budget is increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1811.02640 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel formulation by reframing the active learning as a reinforcement learning problem and explicitly learning a data selection policy, where the policy takes the role of the active learning heuristic. Importantly, our method allows the selection policy learned using simulation on one language to be transferred to other languages. We demonstrate our method using cross-lingual named entity recognition, observing uniform improvements over traditional active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Comment: To appear in EMNLP 2017 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The problem is that the budget for annotation is limited. One solution to this is active learning, where a model asks human to annotate data that it perceived as uncertain. A variety of recent methods have been proposed to apply active learning to deep networks but most of them are either designed speciﬁc for their target tasks or computationally inefﬁcient for large networks. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method that is simple but task-agnostic, and works efﬁciently with the deep networks. We attach a small parametric module, named “loss prediction module,” to a target network, and learn it to predict target losses of unlabeled inputs. Then, this module can suggest data that the target model is likely to produce a wrong prediction. This method is task-agnostic as networks are learned from a single loss regardless of target tasks. We rigorously validate our method through image classiﬁcation, object detection, and human pose estimation, with the recent network architectures. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the previous methods over the tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/CVPR.2019.00018                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Our framework inherits from recent advances in Bayesian deep learning, and extends existing work by considering the targeted crowdsourcing approach, where multiple annotators with unknown expertise contribute an uncontrolled amount (often limited) of annotations. Our framework leverages the low-rank structure in annotations to learn individual annotator expertise, which then helps to infer the true labels from noisy and sparse annotations. It provides a unified Bayesian model to simultaneously infer the true labels and train the deep learning model in order to reach an optimal learning efficacy. Finally, our framework exploits the uncertainty of the deep learning model during prediction as well as the annotators’ estimated expertise to minimize the number of required annotations and annotators for optimally training the deep learning model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework for intent classification in Alexa (Amazon’s personal assistant), using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experiments show that our framework can accurately learn annotator expertise, infer true labels, and effectively reduce the amount of annotations in model training as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We further discuss the potential of our proposed framework in bridging machine learning and crowdsourcing towards improved human-in-the-loop systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1145/3178876.3186033                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In medical imaging, algorithmic solutions based on DL have been shown to achieve high performance on tasks that previously required medical experts. However, DL-based solutions for disease detection have been proposed without methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision. In contrast, a physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate drop-out based Bayesian uncertainty measures for DL in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus images and show that it captures uncertainty better than straightforward alternatives. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral can improve diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks and datasets show robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as recommended by the NHS when referring 0−20% of the most uncertain decisions for further inspection. We analyse causes of uncertainty by relating intuitions from 2D visualizations to the high-dimensional image space. While uncertainty is sensitive to clinically relevant cases, sensitivity to unfamiliar data samples is task dependent, but can be rendered more robust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1038/s41598-017-17876-z                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It is a key step for knowledge base creation and text mining. Recent adaptation of deep learning methods for ER mitigates the need for dataset-specific feature engineering by constructing distributed representations of entity records. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance over benchmark data, they require large amounts of labeled data, which are typically unavailable in realistic ER applications. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based method that targets low-resource settings for ER through a novel combination of transfer learning and active learning. We design an architecture that allows us to learn a transferable model from a high-resource setting to a low-resource one. To further adapt to the target dataset, we incorporate active learning that carefully selects a few informative examples to fine-tune the transferred model. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves comparable, if not better, performance compared to state-of-the-art learning-based methods while using an order of magnitude fewer labels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Comment: This paper is accepted by ACL 2019 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task | USER-NOTES: {"Philipp"=>["They perform entity RESOLUTION, that is more relation classification task."]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Object recognition systems typically need a large amount of training data for satisfactory performance. The problem is particularly acute when many object categories are present. In this paper we present a batch-mode active learning framework for multi-class image classiﬁcation systems. In active learning, images are to be chosen for interactive labeling, instead of passively accepting training data. Our framework addresses two important issues: i) it handles redundancy between different images which is crucial when batch-mode selection is performed; and ii) we pose batchselection as a submodular function optimization problem that makes an inherently intractable problem efﬁcient to solve, while having approximation guarantees. We show results on image classiﬁcation data in which our approach substantially reduces the amount of training required over the baseline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509293                  | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Unlike the standard (CGAN) that generates images from discrete categorical labels, our architecture handles both continuous and discrete scales. Given pairwise comparisons of images, our model, called RankCGAN, performs two tasks: it learns to rank images using a subjective measure; and it learns a generative model that can be controlled by that measure. RankCGAN associates each subjective measure of interest to a distinct dimension of some latent space. We perform experiments on UT-Zap50K, PubFig and OSR datasets and demonstrate that the model is expressive and diverse enough to conduct two-attribute exploration and image editing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classiﬁed in advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning. Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can signiﬁcantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning (AL) tackles this by querying the most informative samples to be annotated among unlabeled pool. Two promising directions for AL that have been recently explored are task-agnostic approach to select data points that are far from the current labeled pool and task-aware approach that relies on the perspective of task model. Unfortunately, the former does not exploit structures from tasks and the latter does not seem to well-utilize overall data distribution. Here, we propose task-aware variational adversarial AL (TA-VAAL) that modiﬁes task-agnostic VAAL, that considered data distribution of both label and unlabeled pools, by relaxing task learning loss prediction to ranking loss prediction and by using ranking conditional generative adversarial network to embed normalized ranking loss information on VAAL. Our proposed TA-VAAL outperforms state-of-the-arts on various benchmark datasets for classiﬁcations with balanced / imbalanced labels as well as semantic segmentation and its task-aware and task-agnostic AL properties were conﬁrmed with our in-depth analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00807                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

One major hurdle of deep learning approaches is that large sets of labeled data are necessary, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain, particularly in medical image diagnosis applications. Active learning techniques can alleviate this labeling effort. In this paper we investigate some recently proposed methods for active learning with high-dimensional data and convolutional neural network classiﬁers. We compare ensemble-based methods against Monte-Carlo Dropout and geometric approaches. We ﬁnd that ensembles perform better and lead to more calibrated predictive uncertainties, which are the basis for many active learning algorithms. To investigate why Monte-Carlo Dropout uncertainties perform worse, we explore potential differences in isolation in a series of experiments. We show results for MNIST and CIFAR-10, on which we achieve a test set accuracy of 90% with roughly 12,200 labeled images, and initial results on ImageNet. Additionally, we show results on a large, highly class-imbalanced diabetic retinopathy dataset. We observe that the ensemblebased active learning effectively counteracts this imbalance during acquisition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/CVPR.2018.00976                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While Bayesian deep learning can be used to tackle the problem, Bayesian neural networks often require more time and computational power to train than deterministic networks. Our work explores whether fully Bayesian networks are needed to successfully capture model uncertainty. We vary the number and position of Bayesian layers in a network and compare their performance on active learning with the MNIST dataset. We found that we can fully capture the model uncertainty by using only a few Bayesian layers near the output of the network, combining the advantages of deterministic and Bayesian networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines can now be sensorised and the vast amount of data generated can be processed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These can provide insights about the condition of the machine or tool in real-time, which can then be used by decision makers. This is fundamental in order to reach a new level of manufacturing capabilities in the context of Industry 4.0 (Lasi et al, 2014). Most current monitoring solutions rely on the off-line generation of models before they can be used online. This is not ideal when the data holds complex evolving features. There is a lack of approaches that are capable of determining what to learn and when to learn. This paper presents preliminary results on a new deep learning approach based on Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) for online tool condition classification. Based on the uncertainty of the model, the proposed approach can determine using an entropy acquisition function if the incoming data cannot be classified, and therefore needs to be labelled and used for re-training. This constitutes the first step towards an online active learning tool condition monitoring approach. We demonstrate using a machine tool data set that the active learning approach can achieve similar accuracy of a deterministic Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) with a smaller training data set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.7148/2019-0223                           | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It relies on huge amount of data. However, labelling a large amount of data is expensive. Active learning is one of the approaches to alleviate the labelling effort. We propose a new active learning approach for CNN. Different from existing active learning algorithms for CNN, ﬁrst, the active query strategy is measured from multiple views, not only the last output of CNN; second, multiple views are obtained from multiple hidden layers in CNN, not from other related data or models. We evaluate our approach on three widely used datasets: Fashion-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods in image classiﬁcation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/ICME.2019.00236                     | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Given the large size of such datasets, it is conceivable that they contain certain samples that either do not contribute or negatively impact the DNN’s optimization. Modifying the training distribution in a way that excludes such samples could provide an effective solution to both improve performance and reduce training time. In this paper, we propose to scale up ensemble Active Learning methods to perform acquisition at a large scale (10k to 500k samples at a time). We do this with ensembles of hundreds of models, obtained at a minimal computational cost by reusing intermediate training checkpoints. This allows us to automatically and efﬁciently perform a training data subset search for large labeled datasets. We observe that our approach obtains favorable subsets of training data, which can be used to train more accurate DNNs than training with the entire dataset. We perform an extensive experimental study of this phenomenon on three image classiﬁcation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet), analyzing the impact of initialization schemes, acquisition functions and ensemble conﬁgurations. We demonstrate that data subsets identiﬁed with a lightweight ResNet-18 ensemble remain effective when used to train deep models like ResNet-101 and DenseNet121. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that optimizing the training data distribution can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts on large scale vision tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10.1109/TITS.2021.3133268                   | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

But many of these methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), can be difﬁcult to train, in part because they are prone to mode collapse, which means that they characterize only a few modes of the true distribution. To address this, we introduce VEEGAN, which features a reconstructor network, reversing the action of the generator by mapping from data to noise. Our training objective retains the original asymptotic consistency guarantee of GANs, and can be interpreted as a novel autoencoder loss over the noise. In sharp contrast to a traditional autoencoder over data points, VEEGAN does not require specifying a loss function over the data, but rather only over the representations, which are standard normal by assumption. On an extensive set of synthetic and real world image datasets, VEEGAN indeed resists mode collapsing to a far greater extent than other recent GAN variants, and produces more realistic samples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25\\% of the original training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Recent advances in transfer learning for natural language processing in conjunction with active learning open the possibility to significantly reduce the necessary annotation budget. We are the first to thoroughly investigate this powerful combination for the sequence tagging task. We conduct an extensive empirical study of various Bayesian uncertainty estimation methods and Monte Carlo dropout options for deep pre-trained models in the active learning framework and find the best combinations for different types of models. Besides, we also demonstrate that to acquire instances during active learning, a full-size Transformer can be substituted with a distilled version, which yields better computational performance and reduces obstacles for applying deep active learning in practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Comment: In Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL-2021) | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, the applicability of AL to real-world problems remains an open question. While in supervised learning, practitioners can try many different methods, evaluating each against a validation set before selecting a model, AL affords no such luxury. Over the course of one AL run, an agent annotates its dataset exhausting its labeling budget. Thus, given a new task, an active learner has no opportunity to compare models and acquisition functions. This paper provides a large scale empirical study of deep active learning, addressing multiple tasks and, for each, multiple datasets, multiple models, and a full suite of acquisition functions. We find that across all settings, Bayesian active learning by disagreement, using uncertainty estimates provided either by Dropout or Bayes-by Backprop significantly improves over i.i.d. baselines and usually outperforms classic uncertainty sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Comment: To be presented at EMNLP 2018 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, there are now several proposed approaches involving either cross-lingual transfer learning, which learns from other highly resourced languages, or active learning, which efficiently selects effective training data based on model predictions. This paper poses the question: given this recent progress, and limited human annotation, what is the most effective method for efficiently creating high-quality entity recognizers in under-resourced languages? Based on extensive experimentation using both simulated and real human annotation, we find a dual-strategy approach best, starting with a cross-lingual transferred model, then performing targeted annotation of only uncertain entity spans in the target language, minimizing annotator effort. Results demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer is a powerful tool when very little data can be annotated, but an entity-targeted annotation strategy can achieve competitive accuracy quickly, with just one-tenth of training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Comment: Accepted at EMNLP 2019 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Such algorithms assume training-time access to an expert that can provide the optimal action at any queried state; unfortunately, the number of such queries is often prohibitive, frequently rendering these approaches impractical. To combat this query complexity, we consider an active learning setting in which the learning algorithm has additional access to a much cheaper noisy heuristic that provides noisy guidance. Our algorithm, LEAQI, learns a difference classifier that predicts when the expert is likely to disagree with the heuristic, and queries the expert only when necessary. We apply LEAQI to three sequence labeling tasks, demonstrating significantly fewer queries to the expert and comparable (or better) accuracies over a passive approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Comment: ACL 2020 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, manually annotating data is expensive and time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model. In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently, they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach, Active\\mathbf^2 Learning (A\\mathbf^2L), actively adapts to the deep learning model being trained to eliminate such redundant examples chosen by an AL strategy. We show that A\\mathbf^2L is widely applicable by using it in conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce the data requirements of state-of-the-art AL strategies by \\approx \\mathbf3-25% on an absolute scale on multiple NLP tasks while achieving the same performance with virtually no additional computation overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.18653/v1/2021.naacl-main.159             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, pre-training these large multilingual language models requires a lot of training data, which is not available for African Languages. Active learning is a semi-supervised learning algorithm, in which a model consistently and dynamically learns to identify the most beneficial samples to train itself on, in order to achieve better optimization and performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, active learning effectively and practically addresses real-world data scarcity. Despite all its benefits, active learning, in the context of NLP and especially multilingual language models pretraining, has received little consideration. In this paper, we present AfroLM, a multilingual language model pretrained from scratch on 23 African languages (the largest effort to date) using our novel self-active learning framework. Pretrained on a dataset significantly (14x) smaller than existing baselines, AfroLM outperforms many multilingual pretrained language models (AfriBERTa, XLMR-base, mBERT) on various NLP downstream tasks (NER, text classification, and sentiment analysis). Additional out-of-domain sentiment analysis experiments show that \\textbf{AfroLM} is able to generalize well across various domains.

However, duing to various natural and man made factors, more and more wetlands have converted to agricultural land and urban land. Now, the changes in wetlands' area and quantity have caused public's widespread concern. And wetland's management and protection will benefit from the improvement of the wetland information abstraction's precision. Improving the classification precision of the RS image is a difficult problem because of the small scale of remote sensing images. This paper which is about the wetland remote sensing images extraction is based on the LANDSAT ETM remote sensing data, and the result of the Wavelet Packet reconstruction will be used as the sample set of the Active Support Vector Machine .At the end of this paper, a comparative analysis of the experimental results will show between the single classification (SVM, BPNN) method and the solution which is proposed in this article. This method can be proved to obtain very good classification results through many experiments on remote sensing image classification I've done. Experimental results show that this algorithm's classification accuracy is better than the single classification's. Moreover, in the active learning process, the bad influence of the image's isolated and intersection points on the classification is avoided, and the number of training samples are reduced greatly. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1007/978-3-642-18354-6_58                | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, the EMR information is usually in the form of unstructured text, which increases the use cost and hinders its applications. In this work, an effective named entity recognition (NER) method is presented for information extraction on Chinese EMR, which is achieved by word embedding bootstrapped deep active learning to promote the acquisition of medical information from Chinese EMR and to release its value. In this work, deep active learning of bi-directional long short-term memory followed by conditional random field (Bi-LSTM+CRF) is used to capture the characteristics of different information from labeled corpus, and the word embedding models of contiguous bag of words and skip-gram are combined in the above model to respectively capture the text feature of Chinese EMR from unlabeled corpus. To evaluate the performance of above method, the tasks of NER on Chinese EMR with “medical history” content were used. Experimental results show that the word embedding bootstrapped deep active learning method using unlabeled medical corpus can achieve a better performance compared with other models. © 2021, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 10.1007/s12204-021-2285-5                   | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Specifically, a plug-in architecture has been developed which allows components to be added to WordFreak for customized visualization, annotation specification, and automatic annotation, without re-compilation. The APIs for these plug-ins provide mechanisms to allow automatic annotators or taggers to guide future annotation to supports active learning. At present WordFreak can be used to annotate a number of different types of annotation in English, Chinese, and Arabic including: constituent parse structure and dependent annotations, and ACE named-entity and coreference annotation.

Named entity recognition is a basic and core task of Web farming. However, the existing named entity recognition methods mainly depend on the complete, high-quality and well-labelled data sets and cannot meet the requirements of real-world applications. This paper proposes a continuous learning method for recognizing named entity by introducing the Web farming mode of Web Intelligence into the recognizing process. During the on-line stage, the domain contextual relevance of candidate entities is calculated by using the domain discrimination degree and the domain dependence function for recognizing the target entities. During the off-line stage, an active learning approach is designed to continuously improve the target corpus set by binding density-based clustering with semantic distance measurement. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of entity recognition and is more suitable for real-world applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s11280-019-00758-x                  | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The training performance is limited with few labelled data. One solution is active learning, which can achieve ideal results by multi-round sampling strategy to augment unlabelled data. However, there is very few labelled data in the early rounds, which leads to slow improvement on training performance. We thus propose a framework of data augmentation while active learning. To validate our claims, we focus on Chinese NER task and carry out extensive experiments on two public datasets. Experimental results show that our framework is effective for a series of classical query strategy. We can achieve 99% of the best deep model trained on full data using only 22% of the data on Resume, 63% labelled data is reduced as compared to pure active learning (PAL).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-030-82147-0_8                 | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This paper describes the development of the AL-CRF model, which is a NER approach based on active learning (AL). The algorithmic sequence of the processes performed by the AL-CRF model is the following: first, the samples are clustered using the k-means approach. Then, stratified sampling is performed on the produced clusters in order to obtain initial samples, which are used to train the basic conditional random field (CRF) classifier. The next step includes the initiation of the selection process which uses the criterion of entropy. More specifically, samples having the highest entropy values are added to the training set. Afterwards, the learning process is repeated, and the CRF classifier is retrained based on the obtained training set. The learning and the selection process of the AL is running iteratively until the harmonic mean F stabilizes and the final NER model is obtained. Several NER experiments are performed on legislative and medical cases in order to validate the AL-CRF performance. The testing data include Chinese judicial documents and Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). Testing indicates that our proposed algorithm has better recognition accuracy and recall rate compared to the conventional CRF model. Moreover, the main advantage of our approach is that it requires fewer manually labelled training samples, and at the same time, it is more effective. This can result in a more cost effective and more reliable process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1155/2018/1890683                        | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French. We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn and evaluate several classification models that can be configured in a cascaded pipeline. We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set. We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca. 83% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features. The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca. 70 and 68% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns. In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages. A substantial part of the article investigates the role of active learning techniques for reducing the number of examples to be manually annotated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s10791-008-9070-z                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Unlike formal text, such as news articles and pieces of longer content, tweets are of a specific nature: short, noisy, and with dynamic content. Thus, it is difficult to apply the traditional natural language processing algorithms to analyze them. Active learning is well-suited to many problems in natural language processing, especially when unlabeled data may be abundant, but labeled data is limited. The method proposed here aims to minimize annotation costs while maximizing the desired performance from the model. The method recognizes named entities from tweet streams on Twitter by using an active learning method with different query strategies. The tweets are queried for labeling by a human annotator based on query-by-committee, uncertainty-based sampling, and diversity-based sampling. The experimental evaluations of the proposed method on tweet data achieved better results than random sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The patterns are reduced regular expressions composed of various characteristics of features useful in information extraction. Our major contribution is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that extracts information from a set of examples labeled as relevant or irrelevant to a given attribute. The approach is semi-supervised because it does not require precise labeling of the exact location of features in the training data. This significantly reduces the effort needed to develop a training set. An active learning algorithm is used to assist the semi-supervised learning algorithm to further reduce the training set development effort. The active learning algorithm is seeded with a single positive example of a given attribute. The context of the seed is used to automatically identify candidates for additional positive examples of the given attribute. Candidate examples are manually pruned during the active learning phase, and our semi-supervised learning algorithm automatically discovers reduced regular expressions for each attribute. We have successfully applied this learning technique in the extraction of textual features from police incident reports, university crime reports, and patents. The performance of our algorithm compares favorably with competitive extraction systems being used in criminal justice information systems. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We use a semi-supervised approach which uses a small annotated corpus and a large raw corpus for the Hindi NER task using maximum entropy classifier. A novel statistical annotation confidence measure is proposed for the purpose. The confidence measure is used in selective sampling based semi-supervised NER. Also a prior modulation of maximum entropy classifier is used where the annotation confidence values are used as \`prior weight'. The superiority of the proposed technique over baseline classifier is demonstrated extensively through experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-642-11164-8_36                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While a lot of papers have been presented on applying AL to natural language processing tasks reporting impressive savings, little work has been done on defining a stopping criterion. In this work, we present a stopping criterion for active learning based on the way instances are selected during uncertainty-based sampling and verify its applicability in a variety of settings. The statistical learning models used in our study are support vector machines (SVMs), maximum entropy models and Bayesian logistic regression and the tasks performed are text classification, named entity recognition and shallow parsing. In addition, we present a method for multiclass mutually exclusive SVM active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1016/j.csl.2007.12.001                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

ObjectivesNamed entity recognition (NER), a sequential labeling task, is one of the fundamental tasks for building clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems. Machine learning (ML) based approaches can achieve good performance, but they often require large amounts of annotated samples, which are expensive to build due to the requirement of domain experts in annotation. Active learning (AL), a sample selection approach integrated with supervised ML, aims to minimize the annotation cost while maximizing the performance of ML-based models. In this study, our goal was to develop and evaluate both existing and new AL methods for a clinical NER task to identify concepts of medical problems, treatments, and lab tests from the clinical notes. MethodsUsing the annotated NER corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge that contained 349 clinical documents with 20,423 unique sentences, we simulated AL experiments using a number of existing and novel algorithms in three different categories including uncertainty-based, diversity-based, and baseline sampling strategies. They were compared with the passive learning that uses random sampling. Learning curves that plot performance of the NER model against the estimated annotation cost (based on number of sentences or words in the training set) were generated to evaluate different active learning and the passive learning methods and the area under the learning curve (ALC) score was computed. ResultsBased on the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of sentences, uncertainty sampling algorithms outperformed all other methods in ALC. Most diversity-based methods also performed better than random sampling in ALC. To achieve an F-measure of 0.80, the best method based on uncertainty sampling could save 66% annotations in sentences, as compared to random sampling. For the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of words, uncertainty sampling methods again outperformed all other methods in ALC. To achieve 0.80 in F-measure, in comparison to random sampling, the best uncertainty based method saved 42% annotations in words. But the best diversity based method reduced only 7% annotation effort. ConclusionIn the simulated setting, AL methods, particularly uncertainty-sampling based approaches, seemed to significantly save annotation cost for the clinical NER task. The actual benefit of active learning in clinical NER should be further evaluated in a real-time setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.09.010                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due.It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: survey                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 10.1145/3472291                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 1       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In order to achieve the best performance, these systems are generally trained on a large human annotated corpus. Since annotating such corpora is a very expensive and time-consuming procedure, manually annotating corpora is become one of the significant issues in many text based tasks such as text mining, semantic annotation, Named Entity Recognition and generally Information Extraction. Semi-supervised Learning and Active Learning are two distinct approaches that deal with reduction of labeling costs. Based on their natures, Active and semi-supervised learning can produce better results when they are jointly applied. In this paper we propose a combined Semi-Supervised and Active Learning approach for Sequence Labeling which extremely reduces manual annotation cost in a way that only highly uncertain tokens need to be manually labeled and other sequences and subsequences are labeled automatically. The proposed approach reduces manual annotation cost around 90% compare with a supervised learning and 30% in contrast with a similar fully active learning approach. Conditional Random Field CRF is chosen as the underlying learning model due to its promising performance in many sequence labeling tasks. In addition we proposed a confidence measure based on the model's variance reduction that reaches a considerable accuracy for finding informative samples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Pattern rule induction is one kind of main methods to do information extraction. Manually constructing pattern rules is tedious and error prone. In this paper, we present GRID<sub>C</sub>oTrain, a weakly supervised paradigm by bootstrapping GRID (a supervised rule induction system) with cotraining and active learning. We also utilize external knowledge resource such as WordNet and existing ontology knowledge to optimize the learned pattern rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this framework, the annotation work is performed as an iterative and interactive process between the human annotator and a probabilistic named entity tagger. At each iteration, sentences that are most likely to contain named entities of the target category are selected by the probabilistic tagger and presented to the annotator. This iterative annotation process is repeated until the estimated coverage reaches the desired level. Unlike active learning approaches, our framework produces a named entity corpus that is free from the sampling bias introduced by the active strategy. We evaluated our framework by simulating the annotation process using two named entity corpora and show that our approach could drastically reduce the number of sentences to be annotated when applied to sparse named entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most current event extraction systems rely on local information at the phrase or sentence level. However, this local context may be insufficient to resolve ambiguities in identifying particular types of events; information from a wider scope can serve to resolve some of these ambiguities. In this thesis, we first investigate how to extract supervised and unsupervised features to improve a supervised baseline system. Then, we present two additional tasks to show the benefit of wider scope features in semi-supervised learning (self training) and active learning (co-testing). Experiments show that using features from wider scope can not only aid a supervised local event extraction baseline system, but also help the semi-supervised or active learning approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | AAI3524290 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Book/dissertation"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, there are very few studies of the NER task for open-domain collections and in low-resource settings. We focus on NER for low-resource collections, in which any entity types of practical interest to the users of the system must be supported. We try to achieve this with a low cost of annotation of data from the target domain/collection. We propose an entity recognition framework that combines active learning and conditional random fields (CRF), and which provides the flexibility to define new entity types as needed by the users. Our experiments on a help &amp; support corpus show that the system can achieve F1 measure of 0.77 by relying on only 100 manually-annotated sentences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3357384.3358109                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

If completely labeled documents are available for training, well-known Markov model techniques can be used to learn such classifiers. In this paper, we consider the more challenging task of learning hidden Markov models (HMMs) when only partially (sparsely) labeled documents are available for training. We first give detailed account of the task and its appropriate loss function, and show how it can be minimized given an HMM. We describe an EM style algorithm for learning HMMs from partially labeled data. We then present an active learning algorithm that selects "difficult" unlabeled tokens and asks the user to label them. We study empirically by how much active learning reduces the required data labeling effort, or increases the quality of the learned model achievable with a given amount of user effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Its aim is to identify and to classify the named entities in the textual data into predetermined categories. There are a large number of supervised learning and deep learning models being developed for the entity recognition task, which performs well in the presence of a labeled training set. The availability of the labeled training set requires the labeling of large unlabeled data, which is both expensive and time taking. Active learning is an iterative approach that provides a way to minimize labeling cost without affecting performance. This approach uses a sampling strategy that selects the appropriate unlabeled data instances, an oracle to label the selected data instances, and a machine learning model (base classifier). In this work, a modified least confidence-based query sampling strategy for the active learning approach for named entity recognition task has been proposed, which considers different numbers of uncertain words present within the sentences to compute the final least confidence score of the sentence for comparison. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the comparison of the performance is made among the active learning approaches with the proposed sampling strategy, random sampling strategy, and two other well-known existing uncertainty query sampling strategies. Real-world scenario for active learning approach is simulated for experiment, and the total amount of labeled data required for training of active learner to reach the stop condition while using different sampling strategies is recorded. The experiment is carried for the development and the test set of the three different biomedical corpora and a Spanish language NER corpus. It is found that with the proposed active learning approach, there is a minimal requirement of labeled data for training to reach the above performance level in comparison with the other approaches. The performance of the proposed approach is found to be slightly better than the existing sampling approach, and the performance of all the approaches is far better than the random sampling approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s13748-021-00230-w                  | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, there is a limited quantity of labeled pre-plans data due to the high labeling cost. This paper proposes an active learning-based sequence labeling method, aiming at achieving good deep learning model performance with only a small amount of labeled data. It proposes a sample selection strategy based on uncertainty and slot, in which the uncertainty and slot respectively represent the informativeness and representativeness of the sample. Meanwhile, to avoid getting into local details in each round of model training, a method for evaluating the performance of data labeling is proposed. Based on these two works, the active learning and data labeling processes are also present. We use four strategies as comparative methods in our experiment, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms other active learning methods. We conclude that our method is efficient and applicable to tasks involving the labeling of textual data in other contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose an active learning approach in which the machine solicits "labels" on features rather than instances. In both simulated and real user experiments on two sequence labeling tasks we show that our active learning method outperforms passive learning with features as well as traditional active learning with instances. Preliminary experiments suggest that novel interfaces which intelligently solicit labels on multiple features facilitate more efficient annotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While the sequence labeling formulation is the major approach, we explore a method that takes examples of terms as input and outputs phrases in the same category as the given terms to avoid the heavy cost for building a training dataset. The existing methods in this direction are template-based, which the user cannot give any feedback to the system even if some of the extracted terms are not intended. This paper proposes a framework for extracting technical terms that considers the user’s feedback by adopting active learning approach. The proposed method can extract terms consisting of multiple words by dynamically accessing an inverted index created in advance. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the straightforward application of active learning to an existing method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3487664.3487706                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To fully employ the prior-knowledge of the pre-trained language models, some research works formulate the NER task into the machine reading comprehension form (MRC-form) to enhance their model generalization capability of commonsense knowledge. However, this transformation still faces the data-hungry issue with limited training data for the specific NER tasks. To address the low-resource issue in NER, we introduce a method named active multi-task-based NER (AMT-NER), which is a two-stage multi-task active learning training model. Specifically, A multi-task learning module is first introduced into AMT-NER to improve its representation capability in low-resource NER tasks. Then, a two-stage training strategy is proposed to optimize AMT-NER multi-task learning. An associated task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) is also employed to enhance its commonsense knowledge further. More importantly, AMT-NER introduces an active learning module, uncertainty selective, to actively filter training data to help the NER model learn efficiently. Besides, we also find different external supportive data under different pipelines improves model performance differently in the NER tasks. Extensive experiments are performed to show the superiority of our method, which also proves our findings that the introduction of external knowledge is significant and effective in the MRC-form NER tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Just Accepted | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Full-Text only in version \\"just accepted\\""]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 10.1145/3593023                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This objective function, called the policy Gibbs error, is the expected error rate of a random classifier drawn from the prior distribution on the examples adaptively selected by the active learning policy. Exact maximization of the policy Gibbs error is hard, so we propose a greedy strategy that maximizes the Gibbs error at each iteration, where the Gibbs error on an instance is the expected error of a random classifier selected from the posterior label distribution on that instance. We apply this maximum Gibbs error criterion to three active learning scenarios: non-adaptive, adaptive, and batch active learning. In each scenario, we prove that the criterion achieves near-maximal policy Gibbs error when constrained to a fixed budget. For practical implementations, we provide approximations to the maximum Gibbs error criterion for Bayesian conditional random fields and transductive Naive Bayes. Our experimental results on a named entity recognition task and a text classification task show that the maximum Gibbs error criterion is an effective active learning criterion for noisy models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We propose a new active learning framework for sequence labelling which take the change of probability into account. At each iteration of the proposed method, every time the human annotator manually annotates a token, the output probabilities of the other tokens in the sequence are re-estimated. This proposed method is expected to reduce the amount of human annotation required for obtaining a high labelling performance. Through experiments on the NP chunking dataset provided by CoNLL, we empirically show that the proposed method works well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) under wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We develop a method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learner, Conditional Random Field (CRF). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity extraction from biomedical domain. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/2345396.2345532                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We evaluate the utility of active learning in crowdsourcing on two tasks, named entity recognition and sentiment detection, and show that active learning outperforms random selection of annotation examples in a noisy crowdsourcing scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Consequently, it is of utmost importance to minimize the amount of labeled data that is required to learn a target concept. In the work presented here, I focus on reducing the need for labeled data in multi-view learning tasks. The key characteristic of multi-view learning tasks is that the target concept can be independently learned within different views (i.e., disjoint sets of features that are sufficient to learn the concept of interest). For instance, robot navigation is a 2-view learning task because a robot can learn to avoid obstacles based on either sonar or vision sensors. In my dissertation, I make three main contributions. First, I introduce Co-Testing, which is an active learning algorithm that exploits multiple views. Co-Testing is based on the idea of learning from mistakes. More precisely, it queries examples on which the views predict a different label: if two views disagree, one of them is guaranteed to make a mistake. In a variety of real-world domains, from information extraction to text classification and discourse tree parsing, Co-Testing outperforms existing active learners. Second, I show that existing multi-view learners can perform unreliably if the views are incompatible or correlated. To cope with this problem, I introduce a robust multi-view learner, Co-EMT, which interleaves semi-supervised and active multi-view learning. My empirical results show that Co-EMT outperforms existing multi-view learners on a wide variety of learning tasks. Third, I introduce a view validation algorithm that predicts whether or not two views are adequate for solving a new, unseen learning task. View validation uses information acquired while solving several exemplar learning tasks to train a classifier that discriminates between tasks for which the views are adequate and inadequate for multi-view learning. My experiments on wrapper induction and text classification show that view validation requires a modest amount of training data to make high accuracy predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | AAI3093962 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Accordingly, the use of active learning (AL) to reduce annotation costs has recently generated considerable interest. The intuition behind AL is that giving the learner the ability to control what data is labeled will yield higher-performing models with less annotation effort. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a method for learning linear classifiers that have worked well for many applications since their introduction and are now in widespread use. Accordingly, AL with SVMs (AL-SVM) is an important area to investigate. In addition to interest in AL-SVM, there has also been considerable interest in dealing effectively with the class imbalance that exists for many applications of machine learning. Class imbalance in the case of binary classification where the target examples are a small proportion of the total number of examples is considered in this dissertation. It’s known from the passive learning literature that SVMs are susceptible to underperforming when there is class imbalance and that methods for addressing class imbalance can signficantly improve performance. However, addressing imbalance during AL has received relatively little attention. One part of this dissertation explores how to effectively address class imbalance during AL-SVM. A main theme is that the process of AL creates training data that has markedly different characteristics than training data created through passive annotation and that modifying the base inference procedure used during AL to take into account the different characteristics of the actively sampled data can lead to more successful active learning. This theme will be explored in detail for the important case of AL-SVM for imbalanced datasets. Experimental results across a range of Information Extraction, Text Classification, and Named Entity Classification tasks show that the new methods, which take into account the skewed data created by the AL scenario, outperform methods which do not take into account the data skew created by the AL scenario. In order to realize the performance gains enabled by AL, an effective method for stopping the process is critical. Stopping too early results in a lower-performing model and stopping too late results in waste of annotation effort. The second part of this dissertation presents a new stopping method based on detecting model stabilization in terms of predictions on data that does not have to be labeled. The principles behind this new method are explained and experimental results across a range of Information Extraction, Text Classification, and Named Entity Classification tasks show that the new method outperforms previous methods, filling a need for a more aggressive stopping method and providing users with more control over the behavior of automatic stopping of active learning.                                                                                                                                       | AAI3360212 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) into wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian languages, namely Hindi and Bengali. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/2345396.2345427                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We are given a relational probabilistic database, where each tuple is correct with some probability; e.g., a database constructed from textual data using information extraction. We are now given a query and we want to determine the correctness of its results. Unlike probabilistic databases, we have an oracle that can resolve the uncertainty, such as a domain expert that can verify data against their sources. Since verification may be costly, our goal is to determine the correct output of the query, while asking the oracle to verify as few tuples as possible. ActivePDB provides an end-to-end solution to this problem. In a nutshell, we first track provenance to identify which input tuples contribute to the derivation of each output tuple, and in what ways. We then design an active learning solution to iteratively choose tuples to be verified based on the provenance structure and on an evolving estimation of the probability of the tuples correctness. We will demonstrate ActivePDB in the context of the NELL database of extracted facts, allowing participants to both pose queries and play the role of oracles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.14778/3554821.3554863                    | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The novel contribution of this paper is in investigating two techniques for making SVM more suitable for language learning tasks. Firstly, we propose an SVM with uneven margins (SVMUM) model to deal with the problem of imbalanced training data. Secondly, SVM active learning is employed in order to alleviate the difficulty in obtaining labelled training data. The algorithms are presented and evaluated on several Information Extraction (IE) tasks, where they achieved better performance than the standard SVM and the SVM with passive learning, respectively. Moreover, by combining SVMUM with the active learning algorithm, we achieve the best reported results on the seminars and jobs corpora, which are benchmark data sets used for evaluation and comparison of machine learning algorithms for IE. In addition, we also evaluate the token based classification framework for IE with three different entity tagging schemes. In comparison to previous methods dealing with the same problems, our methods are both effective and efficient, which are valuable features for real-world applications. Due to the similarity in the formulation of the learning problem for IE and for other NLP tasks, the two techniques are likely to be beneficial in a wide range of applications&lt;xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"&gt;1&lt;/xref&gt;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1017/S1351324908004968                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most existing active learning algorithms mainly rely on an uncertainty measure derived from the probabilistic classifier for query sample selection. However, such approaches suffer from two shortcomings in the context of sequence learning including 1) cold start problem and 2) label sampling dilemma. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a deep-learning-based active learning framework to directly identify query samples from the perspective of adversarial learning. Our approach intends to offer labeling priorities for sequences whose information content are least covered by existing labeled data. We verify our sequence-based active learning approach on two tasks including sequence labeling and sequence generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In the medical domain, clinical guidelines, academic papers, Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and crawled data from the Internet contain essential information. However, those data are usually unstructured but vital to knowledge graph construction. The construction of knowledge graph using unstructured data requires a large number of medical experts to participate in annotations based on their prior experiences and knowledge. Knowledge graphs’ quality highly depends on the performances of medical named entity recognition and relation extraction that are both based on data annotation. However, faced with handling such a large amount of enormous data, manual labelling turns out to be a high labor cost task. Besides, the data is generated rapidly, requiring us to annotate and extract quickly to keep the pace with the data accumulation. Therefore, we propose a named entity recognition and relation extraction framework, AHIAP, to solve these problems mentioned above. AHIAP uses active learning method to reduce the labor cost of the annotation process while maintaining the annotation quality. There are two modules in AHIAP, an active learning module for reducing labor cost and a measurement module to control the quality. By using active learning, AHIAP only takes 200 samples to get to the accuracy of 70%, whereas the standard learning strategy takes 4000 records to get the same accuracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-030-61951-0_7                 | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This can occur when semantics are involved, such as when extracting information or designing visualizations.A computer currently cannot be expected to solve such problems in a completely unsupervised manner. To achieve high productivity anyway, we explicitly consider human effort as a resource. Clearly the algorithm should do as much of the work as is possible, at high quality – but crucially the algorithm should also be smart enough to see where it needs help, what it should ask the user to do, and how it takes those answers into account. This concept relates to emerging fields such as human(-based) computation and active learning, but we put the focus on the proper design and analysis of algorithms, and on the resulting dialogue between algorithm and human, which we call algorithmically-guided user interaction. As a showcase, we argue that this approach should be applied to information extraction from historical maps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3139958.3140032                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In addition, recently we have seen a great increase in the use of RSS feeds. RSS is a semi-structured data format, which allows web sites to syndicate their new content at a specified URL. In this dissertation, we first investigate the information extraction problem, that is, how to extract the embedded data from web pages into a relational format in an easy and reliable manner. The information extraction is usually performed by software tools called wrappers. The manual construction of wrappers is tedious and error-prone, and fully automatic approaches are often not reliable enough. We follow the semi-automatic approach and describe a new wrapper generation system and framework based on active learning. Our goal is to minimize the user effort for training reliable wrappers through design of an interactive training interface that is implemented based on a powerful underlying extraction language and a set of training and ranking algorithms. Our experiments show that our system achieves reliable extraction with a very small amount of user effort. Millions of new pages appear on the Web every day, and most search engines limit users to searches against pages that already exist on the Web and in their index. However, with the help of RSS feeds, such new pages can be easily discovered. In the second part of this thesis, we describe algorithms for information dissemination on the Web. This task is performed by prospective search engines, which allow users to upload queries that will be applied to newly discovered pages. We focus on keyword queries, and present optimizations to enable matching of large numbers of query subscriptions against a stream of newly discovered documents. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can improve the throughput of a well-known algorithm by more than a factor of 20, and allow matching millions of subscription queries per second against hundreds or thousands of incoming documents per node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | AAI3223919 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The patterns are reduced regular expressions composed of various characteristics of features useful in information extraction. The major contribution is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that extracts information from a set of examples labeled as relevant or irrelevant to a given attribute. The approach is semi-supervised because it does not require precise labeling of the exact location of features in the training data. This significantly reduces the effort needed to develop a training set. An active learning algorithm is used to assist the semi-supervised learning algorithm in order to further reduce training set development effort. The active learning algorithm is seeded with a single positive example of a given attribute. The context of the seed is used to automatically identify candidates for additional positive examples of the given attribute. Candidate examples are manually pruned during the active learning phase, and our semi-supervised learning algorithm automatically discovers reduced regular expressions for each attribute. I have successfully applied this learning technique in the extraction of textual features from police incident reports, university crime reports, and patents. The performance of our algorithm compares favorably with competitive extraction systems being used in criminal justice information systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | AAI3215861 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To tackle this challenging problem, we firstly propose a joint machine extraction method based on a hybrid neural network which takes three common NLP tasks—named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE) and event extraction (EE) into consideration. Then, based on the joint model, we propose an efficient active learning algorithm to select the most beneficial sentences to be annotated for further improving the model quality in a batch mode. Experimental results show that the proposed joint framework achieves better performance than state-of-the-art information extraction approaches on standard datasets, and our active algorithm surpasses all baseline methods with just 25% of the original training data and saves more than 70% annotation costs in testing data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-030-62008-0_6                 | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We survey previously used query selection strategies for sequence models, and propose several novel algorithms to address their shortcomings. We also conduct a large-scale empirical comparison using multiple corpora, which demonstrates that our proposed methods advance the state of the art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning (AL) is a means to alleviate the burden of annotation. This paper addresses the problem of knowing when to stop the AL process without having the human annotator make an explicit decision on the matter. We propose and evaluate an intrinsic criterion for committee-based AL of named entity recognizers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

For a given supplier, there can be hundreds of thousands of image documents only some of which contain useful information. Using supervised machine learning techniques has been shown to be effective in recognising these documents for further information extraction. A well known deficiency of supervised learning approaches is that annotating sufficient documents to create an effective model requires valuable human effort. This paper first shows how to obtain a representative sample from a supplier's corpus. Given this sample of unlabelled documents an active learning approach is used to select which documents to annotate first using a normalised certainty measure derived from a soft classifier's prediction distribution. Finally the accuracy of various selection approaches using this certainty measure are compared along each iteration of the active learning cycle. The experiments show that a greedy selection method using the uncertainty measure can significantly reduce the number of annotations required for a certain accuracy. The results provide valuable information for users and more generally illustrate an effective deployment of a machine learning application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3430199.3430214                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most previous studies on NER have been based on supervised machine learning methods that need a large amount of human-annotated training corpus. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised NER model to minimize the time-consuming and labor-intensive task for constructing the training corpus. The proposed model generates weakly labeled training corpus using a distant supervision method. Then, it improves NER accuracy by refining the weakly labeled training corpus using a bagging-based active learning method. In the experiments, the proposed model outperformed the previous semi-supervised model. It showed F1-measure of 0.764 after 15 times of bagging-based active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425938                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The main methods by means of which IE has been tackled rely on supervised learning;the best-performing such methods belong to the class of probabilistic graphical models, and, in particular, to the class of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In this thesis we investigate two major aspects related to textual IE via CRFs: (a) the creation of CRFs models that can outperform the commonly adopted linear- chain CRFs, and the creation of methods for ensuring the quality of training data and for assessing the impact of training data quality on the accuracy of CRFs systems for IE.We start by facing the task of IE from medical documents written in the Italian language. We propose two novel approaches: (i) a cascaded, two-stage method composed by two layers of CRFs, and (ii) a confidence-weighted ensemble method that combines standard linear-chain CRFs and the proposed two-stage method. Both the proposed models are shown to outperform a standard linear-chain CRFs system.We then investigate aspect-oriented sentence-level opinion mining from product reviews, that consists in predicting, for all sentences in the review, whether the sentence expresses a positive, neutral, or negative opinion (or no opinion at all) about a specific aspect of the product. We propose a set of increasingly powerful models based on CRFs, including a hierarchical multi-label CRFs scheme that jointly models the overall opinion expressed in a product review and the set of aspect-specific opinions expressed in each of its sentences. The proposed CRFs models are shown to obtain better results than linear-chain CRFs.We then study the impact that the quality of training data has on the accuracy of an IE system via experiments performed on a dataset in which inter-coder agreement data are available. Finally, we investigate active learning techniques for a type of semi-supervised CRFs specifically devised for partially labeled sequences. We show that margin-based strategies always obtain the best results on the four tasks we have tested them on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: select subsequences | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Chapter 5"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10.1145/2641383.2641394                     | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 1               | 0             | 0     |

ObjectiveTo build a comprehensive corpus covering syntactic and semantic annotations of Chinese clinical texts with corresponding annotation guidelines and methods as well as to develop tools trained on the annotated corpus, which supplies baselines for research on Chinese texts in the clinical domain. Materials and methodsAn iterative annotation method was proposed to train annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions, and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus. ResultsThe syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with 47,426 tokens and 2612 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes 992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7693 relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good quality, and the system modules are effective. DiscussionThe annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain. However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency. ConclusionsIn this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.04.006                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A novel feature weighting mechanism is also employed to obtain more useful cues from most important linguistic features. Moreover, to overcome the limitation of computational resources in building a high-quality named entity recognition system from a large-scale corpus, informative samples are selected by an active learning approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-540-30211-7_10                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Seed selection refers to choosing an initial sample set to label to form an initial learning model. Sample selection refers to selecting informative samples to update the model at each iteration of the active learning process. Compared to supervised machine learning approaches, active learning offers the opportunity to build statistical classifiers with a reduced amount of training samples that require manual annotation. Reducing the manual annotation effort can support automating the clinical information extraction process. This is particularly beneficial in the clinical domain, where manual annotation is a time-consuming and costly task, as it requires extensive labor from clinical experts. Our empirical findings demonstrate that a using sequence representations along with the length of sequence for seed selection shows potential towards more effective initial models, and b using sequence representations for sample selection leads to significantly lower manual annotation efforts, with up to 3% and 6% fewer tokens and concepts requiring annotation, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art query strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1002/asi.23936                           | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, in the medical professional field, training a high-quality named entity recognition system always requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are highly expensive to obtain. In this article, to lower the cost of data annotation and maximizing the use of unlabeled data, we propose a hybrid approach to recognizing the entities in Chinese electronic medical record, which is in combination of loss-based active learning and semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we adopted a dynamic balance strategy to dynamically balance the minimum loss predicted by a named entity recognition decoder and a loss prediction module at different stages in the process. Experimental results demonstrated our proposed framework’s effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher performances than existing approaches on Chinese EMR entity recognition datasets under limited labeling resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3588314                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper we extend the CW approach for sequence learning and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on four noun phrase chucking and named entity recognition tasks. We then derive few algorithmic approaches to estimate the prediction's correctness of each label in the output sequence. We show that our approach provides a reliable relative correctness information as it outperforms other alternatives in ranking label-predictions according to their error. We also show empirically that our methods output close to absolute estimation of error. Finally, we show how to use this information to improve active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We refer to the former capability as corrective feedback and the latter as persistent learning. While these capabilities have a natural implementation for simple classification tasks such as spam filtering, we argue that a more careful design is required for structured classification tasks. One example of a structured classification task is information extraction, in which raw text is analyzed to automatically populate a database. In this work, we augment a probabilistic information extraction system with corrective feedback and persistent learning components to assist the user in building, correcting, and updating the extraction model. We describe methods of guiding the user to incorrect predictions, suggesting the most informative fields to correct, and incorporating corrections into the inference algorithm. We also present an active learning framework that minimizes not only how many examples a user must label, but also how difficult each example is to label. We empirically validate each of the technical components in simulation and quantify the user effort saved. We conclude that more efficient corrective feedback mechanisms lead to more effective persistent learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

To work well, such a process must be adaptable to variations in list format, tolerant of OCR errors, and careful in its selection of human guidance. We propose ListReader, a wrapper-induction solution for information extraction that is specialized for lists in OCRed documents. ListReader can induce either a regular-expression grammar or a Hidden Markov Model. Each can infer list structure and field labels from OCR text. We decrease the cost and improve the accuracy of the induction process using semi-supervised machine learning and active learning, allowing induction of a wrapper from almost a single hand-labeled instance per field per list. After applying an induced wrapper, ListReader automatically maps the labeled text it produces to a rich variety of ontologically structured predicates. We evaluate our implementation on family history books in terms of the typical F-measure and a new metric, "Label Efficiency", which measures both extraction quality and cost in a single number. We show with statistical significance that ListReader reaches values closer to optimal levels than a state-of-the-art statistical sequence labeler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/2501115.2501132                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Further, the supervised model strongly depends on the huge training data. Active learning is a different way rather than relying on a large amount random sampling. However, random sampling constructively participates in the optimal choosing training examples. Based on different query strategies, active learning can combine with other machine learning methods to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining the accuracy. This paper proposes a new active learning strategy based on Information Density (ID) integrated with CRFs for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER). On Sighan bakeoff 2006 MSRA NER corpus, an F1 score of 77.2% is achieved by using only 10,000 labeled training sentences chosen by the proposed active learning strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: dataset not latin written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 1                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Deep active learning algorithms were designed to reduce the annotation cost for training such models. Current deep active learning algorithms, however, aim at training a good deep learning model with as little labeled data as possible, and as such are not useful in scenarios where the full dataset must be labeled. As a solution to this problem, this work investigates deep active-self learning algorithms that employ self-labeling using the trained model to help alleviate the cost of annotating full datasets for named entity recognition tasks. The experiments performed indicate that the proposed deep active-self learning algorithm is capable of reducing manual annotation costs for labeling the complete dataset for named entity recognition with less than 2% of the self labeled tokens being mislabeled. We also investigate an early stopping technique that doesn’t rely on a validation set, which effectively reduces even further the annotation costs of the proposed active-self learning algorithm in real world scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-030-91699-2_28                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most previous works applied active learning on Named Entity Recognition (token-level task) similar to the text classification (sentence-level task). They failed to consider the heterogeneity of uncertainty within each sentence and required access to the entire sentence for the annotator when labelling. To overcome the mentioned limitations, in this paper, we allow the active learning algorithm to query subsequences within sentences and propose an Entity-Aware Subsequences-based Active Learning (EASAL) that utilizes an effective Head-Tail pointer to query one entity-aware subsequence for each sentence based on BERT. For other tokens outside this subsequence, we randomly select 30% of these tokens to be pseudo-labelled for training together where the model directly predicts their pseudo-labels. Experimental results on both news and biomedical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1609/aaai.v37i7.26069                    | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

As a typical representative of medical security risks and NER, the NER model of online social media based on active learning has attracted worldwide attention. NER is an important part of natural language processing. Traditional recognition technology usually requires a lot of external information, and through the manual identification of its features, which costs a lot of time and energy. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional recognition algorithms and the lack of feature extraction in network media NER, a new active learning model was introduced in this paper. In the information age, people are increasingly demanding for a large amount of text information, and NER technology came into being. Its main function is to accurately identify important information from text and provide useful information for high-level work. The initial design of NER system is mainly based on the recognition of rules, so as to realize the recognition of named entities. However, in a complex network environment, it takes a lot of time and energy to establish rules without conflicts, and it has poor mobility. In recent years, with the continuous development of computer technology, the use of machine learning to actively learn the unknown information in the target area reduces the workload of manual annotation, thus realizing the active learning of large amounts of data. The research showed that the recognition accuracy under the traditional NER was low, and the information processing speed was slow; the accuracy rate of NER based on active learning was as high as 97%, and the speed of information processing had also been greatly improved, which had solved many problems under the traditional mode. User satisfaction could be as high as 95%, which showed that the latter had broad prospects. The progress of the new era cannot be separated from the support of new technologies.

Active learning is often used to reduce the amount of annotation effort required to obtain training data for machine learning algorithms. A key component of an active learning approach is the query strategy, which is used to iteratively select samples for annotation. Knowledge resources have been used in information extraction as a means to derive additional features for sample representation. DKI is, however, the first query strategy that exploits such resources to inform sample selection. To evaluate the merits of DKI, in particular with respect to the reduction in annotation effort that the new query strategy allows to achieve, we conduct a comprehensive empirical comparison of active learning query strategies for information extraction within the clinical domain. The clinical domain was chosen for this work because of the availability of extensive structured knowledge resources which have often been exploited for feature generation. In addition, the clinical domain offers a compelling use case for active learning because of the necessary high costs and hurdles associated with obtaining annotations in this domain. Our experimental findings demonstrated that (1) amongst existing query strategies, the ones based on the classification model's confidence are a better choice for clinical data as they perform equally well with a much lighter computational load, and (2) significant reductions in annotation effort are achievable by exploiting knowledge resources within active learning query strategies, with up to 14% less tokens and concepts to manually annotate than with state-of-the-art query strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/2806416.2806550                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

As we gathered members of the program committee, the timeliness of the topic resonated with several of them: the growing body of knowledge on active learning and on active learning for NLP in particular makes this topic one worth exploring in a focused workshop rather than in isolated papers in occasional, far-flung conferences.Labeled data is a prerequisite for many popular algorithms in natural language processing and machine learning. While it is possible to obtain large amounts of annotated data for well-studied languages in well-studied domains and well-studied problems, labeled data are rarely available for less common languages, domains, or problems. Unfortunately, obtaining human annotations for linguistic data is labor-intensive and typically the costliest part of the acquisition of an annotated corpus. It has been shown before that active learning can be employed to reduce annotation costs but not at the expense of quality. While diverse work over the past decade has demonstrated the possible advantages of active learning for corpus annotation and NLP applications, active learning is not widely used in many ongoing data annotation tasks. Much of the machine learning literature on the topic has focused on active learning for classification problems with less attention devoted to the kinds of problems encountered in NLP. Related topics such as distributed "human computation", cost-sensitive machine learning, and semi-supervised learning of all kinds are also growing in number as we search for the best ways to overcome the data acquisition bottleneck.We were interested in bringing together researchers to explore the challenges and opportunities of active learning for NLP tasks, language acquisition, and language learning, and we have been rewarded with excellent submissions and a promising program. The workshop received sixteen submissions, eight of which are included in the final program. Two of the accepted papers are short papers which address ongoing work and pertinent issues. We hope that this gathering and these proceedings begin to shed more light on active learning for NLP classification tasks, sequence labeling, parsing, semantics, and other more complex tasks. The papers in the program also begin to address issues involving the application of active learning in real annotation projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: conference proceedings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 1                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

While this paradigm has enabled rapid advances in IE technology, it remains constrained by a dependence on annotated documents and does not make use of the information available in large corpora. Alternative approaches, which make use of large text collections and inter-document information, are now beginning to emerge - as evidenced by a parallel emergence of interest in learning from unlabelled data in AI in general. For example, some systems learn extraction patterns by exploiting information about their distribution across corpora; others exploit the redundancy of the Internet by assuming that facts with multiple mentions are more reliable. These approaches require large amounts of unannotated text, which is generally easy to obtain, and employ unsupervised or minimally supervised learning algorithms, as well as related techniques such as co-training and active learning. These alternative approaches are complementary to the established IE paradigm based on supervised training, and are now forming a cohesive emergent trend in recent research. They constitute the focus of this workshop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: conference proceedings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                             | 0         | 1                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A primary task that lies at the heart of information extraction is image classification, which refers to classifying images or parts of them as belonging to certain categories. Accurate and reliable image classification has diverse applications—web image and video search, content based image retrieval, medical image analysis, autonomous robotics, gesture-based human computer interfaces, etc. However, considering the large image variability and typically high-dimensional representations, training predictive models requires substantial amounts of annotated data, often provided through human supervision—supplying such data is expensive and tedious. This training bottleneck is the motivation for development of robust algorithms that can build powerful predictive models with little training or supervision. In this thesis, we propose new algorithms for learning with data, particularly focusing on active learning. Instead of passively accepting training data, the basic idea in active learning is to select the most informative data samples for the human to annotate. This can lead to extremely efficient allocation of resources, and results in predictive models that require far fewer training samples compared to the passive setting. We first propose an active sample selection criterion for training large multi-class classifiers with hundreds of categories. The criterion is easy to compute, and extends traditional two-class active learning to the multi-class setting. We then generalize the approach to handle only binary (yes / no) type feedback while still performing classification in the multi-class domain. The proposed modality provides substantial interactive simplicity, and makes it easy to distribute the training process across many users. Active learning has been studied from two different perspectives: selective sampling from a pool, and query synthesis; both perspectives offer different tradeoffs. We propose a formulation that combines both approaches while leveraging their individual strengths resulting in a scalable and efficient multi-class active learning scheme. Experimental results show efficient training of classification systems with a pool of a few million images on a single computer. Active learning is intimately related to a large body of previous work on experiment design and optimal sensing—we discuss the similarities and key differences between the two. A new greedy batch-mode sample selection algorithm is proposed that shows substantial benefits over random batch selection, when iterative querying cannot be applied. We finally discuss two applications of active selection: i) active learning of compact hash codes for fast image search and classification, and ii) incremental learning of a classifier in a resource-constrained environment to handle changing scene conditions. Throughout the thesis, we focus on thorough experimental validation on a variety of image datasets to analyze strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. | AAI3465119 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We show that these selective sampling techniques greatly reduce the number of annotated examples required for the systems to achieve good generalization performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

One application domain of IE is Information Retrieval (IR), which relies on accurate and high-performance IE to retrieve high quality results from massive datasets. Another example of IE is to identify named entities in a text. For example, in the the sentence "Katy Perry lives in the USA", Katy Perry and USA are named entities of types of PERSON and LOCATION, respectively. Also, identify the sentiment expressed in a text is another instance of IE: in the sentence, "This movie was awesome", the expressed sentiment is positive. Finally, IE is concerned with identifying various linguistic aspects of text data, e.g., part of speech of words, noun phrases, dependency parses, etc., which can serve as features for additional IE tasks. This tutorial introduces participants to a) the usage of Python based, open-source tools that support IE from social media data (mainly Twitter), and b) best practices for ensuring the responsible use of IE and research data. Participants will learn and practice various lexical, semantic, and syntactic IE techniques that are commonly used for analyzing tweets. Participants will also be familiarized with the landscape of publicly available social media data (including popular NLP and IE benchmarks) and methods for collecting and preparing them for analysis. Furthermore, participants will be trained to use a suite of open source tools (SAIL for active learning, TwitterNER for named entity recognition, TweetNLP for transformer based NLP, and SocialMediaIE for multi task learning), which utilize advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning, active learning with human-in-the-loop, multi-lingual, and multi-task learning) to perform IE on their own or existing datasets. Participants will also learn how social contexts of text production and usage of results can be integrated into IE systems to improve these systems and to consider the role of time in improving social media IE quality. Finally, participants will learn about the governance of social media data for research purposes. The tools introduced in the tutorial will focus on the three main stages of IE, namely, collection of data (including annotation), data processing and analytics, and visualization of the extracted information.

However, despite this enormous potential, few IE systems have successfully made the transition from laboratory to commercial application. The reason may be a purely practical one—to build useable, scaleable IE systems requires bringing together a range of different technologies as well as providing clear and reproducible guidelines as to how to collectively configure and deploy those technologies.This paper is an attempt to address these issues. The paper focuses on two primary goals. Firstly, we show that an information extraction system which is used for real world applications and different domains can be built using some autonomous, corporate components (agents). Such a system has some advanced properties: clear separation to different extraction tasks and steps, portability to multiple application domain, trainability, extensibility, etc. Secondly, we show that machine learning and, in particular, learning in different ways and at different levels, can be used to build practical IE systems. We show that carefully selecting the right machine learning technique for the right task and selective sampling can be used to reduce the human effort required to annotate examples for building such systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1023/B:APIN.0000033637.51909.04          | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The community of Information Retrieval (IR) relies on accurate and high-performance IE to be able to retrieve high quality results from massive datasets. One example of IE is to identify named entities in a text, e.g., “Barack Obama served as the president of the USA”. Here, Barack Obama and USA are named entities of types of PERSON and LOCATION, respectively. Another example is to identify sentiment expressed in a text, e.g., “This movie was awesome”. Here, the sentiment expressed is positive. Finally, identifying various linguistic aspects of a text, e.g., part of speech tags, noun phrases, dependency parses, etc., which can serve as features for additional IE tasks. This tutorial introduces participants to a) the usage of Python based, open-source tools that support IE from social media data (mainly Twitter), and b) best practices for ensuring the reproducibility of research. Participants will learn and practice various semantic and syntactic IE techniques that are commonly used for analyzing tweets. Additionally, participants will be familiarized with the landscape of publicly available tweet data, and methods for collecting and preparing them for analysis. Finally, participants will be trained to use a suite of open source tools ( for active learning, for named entity recognition3, and for multi task learning), which utilize advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning, active learning with human-in-the-loop, multi-lingual, and multi-task learning) to perform IE on their own or existing datasets. Participants will also learn how social context can be integrated in Information Extraction systems to make them better. The tools introduced in the tutorial will focus on the three main stages of IE, namely, collection of data (including annotation), data processing and analytics, and visualization of the extracted information.

We prove that deterministic NSTTs capture the class of queries definable in monadic second order logic (MSO) in trees, which Gottlob and Koch (2002) argue to have the right expressiveness for Web information extraction, and prove that monadic queries defined by NSTTs can be answered efficiently. We present a new polynomial time algorithm in RPNI -style that learns monadic queries defined by deterministic NSTTs from completely annotated examples, where all selected nodes are distinguished.In practice, users prefer to provide partial annotations. We propose to account for partial annotations by intelligent tree pruning heuristics. We introduce pruning NSTT s –a formalism that shares many advantages of NSTTs. This leads us to an interactive learning algorithm for monadic queries defined by pruning NSTTs, which satisfies a new formal active learning model in the style of Angluin (1987).We have implemented our interactive learning algorithm integrated it into a visually interactive Web information extraction system–called SQUIRREL –by plugging it into the Mozilla Web browser. Experiments on realistic Web documents confirm excellent quality with very few user interactions during wrapper induction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s10994-006-9613-8                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning has been shown to reduce the amount of labelled data required to train a supervised learner by selectively sampling more informative data points for human annotation. We inspect double annotation data from the same domain and quantify potential problems concerning annotators' performance. For data selectively sampled according to different selection metrics, we find lower inter-annotator agreement and higher per token annotation times. However, overall results confirm the utility of active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This paper explores various Active Self-Learning algorithms for named entity recognition tasks. Firstly, we investigate the impact of different self-training techniques on Active Self-Learning algorithms. Secondly, we propose a novel token-level Active Self-Learning algorithm that achieves near-peak performance using fewer hand-annotated tokens compared to existing works. Through numerous experiments, we found that the sentence-level Active Self-Learning algorithm did not consistently yield significant results compared to pure active learning. However, our proposed token-level Active Self-Learning algorithm showed promising performance, training a neural model to nearly peak accuracy with fewer human-annotated tokens compared to state-of-the-art active learning baseline algorithms. The experimental results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the superior performance of the token-level Active Self-Learning algorithm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-031-45392-2_31                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We present iSeqL, an interactive tool for the rapid construction of customized text mining models through sequence labeling. With iSeqL, analysts engage in an active learning loop, labeling text instances and iteratively assessing trained models by viewing model predictions in the context of both individual text instances and task-specific visualizations of the full dataset. To build suitable models with limited training data, iSeqL leverages transfer learning and pre-trained contextual word embeddings within a recurrent neural architecture. Through case studies and an online experiment, we demonstrate the use of iSeqL to quickly bootstrap models sufficiently accurate to perform in-depth exploratory analysis. With less than an hour of annotation effort, iSeqL users are able to generate stable outputs over custom extracted entities, including context-sensitive discovery of phrases that were never manually labeled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3377325.3377503                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This is the case in the vast majority of the world's natural languages, where such annotated resources are not readily available. To address these problems, we propose to perform joint inference over a lightly supervised IE pipeline, where all the models are trained using either active learning or unsupervised learning. Using our approach, only 25% of the training sentences in the Chinese portion of the ACE 2005 corpus need to be annotated with entity and event mentions in order for our event coreference resolver to surpass its fully supervised counterpart in performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Thus, with budget constraint, it is important to judiciously select high-quality training data for labelling in order to prevent over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a learning-to-label (L2L) framework leveraging active learning and reinforcement learning to iteratively select data to label for Name Entity Recognition (NER) task. Experimental results show that our approach is more effective than strong previous methods using heuristics and reinforcement learning. With the same number of labeled data, our approach improves the accuracy of NER by 11.91%. Our approach is superior to state-of-the-art learning-to-label method, with an improvement of accuracy by 6.49%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-030-73197-7_36                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

It samples a small set of data to annotate actively and is widely applied in various AI tasks. It uses an iterative process, during which we utilize the current trained model to evaluate all unlabeled samples and annotate the best samples based on a specific query strategy to update the underlying model iteratively. Most existing active learning approaches rely on only the evaluation results generated by the current model and ignore the results from previous iterations. In this paper, we propose using more historical evaluation results which can provide additional information to help better select samples. First, we apply two kinds of heuristic features of the historical evaluation results, the weighted sum of historical results and the fluctuation of the historical evaluation sequence, to improve the effectiveness of active learning sampling. Next, to further and more globally use the information contained in the historical results, we design a novel query strategy that learns how to select samples based on the historical sequences automatically. Our proposed idea is general and can be combined with both basic and state-of-the-art query strategies to achieve improvements. We test our approaches on two common NLP tasks including text classification and named entity recognition. Experimental results show that our methods significantly promote existing methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1109/TKDE.2020.3045816                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The shortcoming is that a large quantity of manually annotated data is usually required. Previous studies have demonstrated that active learning can considerably reduce the cost of data annotation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. In real applications, we found that existing uncertainty-based active learning strategies have two shortcomings. First, these strategies prefer to choose long sequences explicitly or implicitly, which increases the annotation burden of annotators. Second, some strategies need to revise and modify the model to generate additional information for sample selection, which increases the workload of the developer and increases the training/prediction time of the model. In this paper, we first examine traditional active learning strategies in specific cases of Word2Vec-BiLSTM-CRF and Bert-CRF that have been widely used in named entity recognition on several typical datasets. Then, we propose an uncertainty-based active learning strategy called the lowest token probability (LTP), which combines the input and output of conditional random field (CRF) to select informative instances. LTP is a simple and powerful strategy that does not favor long sequences and does not need to revise the model. We test LTP on multiple real-world datasets, the experiment results show that compared with existing state-of-the-art selection strategies, LTP can reduce about 20% annotation tokens while maintaining competitive performance on both sentence-level accuracy and entity-level F1-score. Additionally, LTP significantly outperformed all other strategies in selecting valid samples, which dramatically reduced the invalid annotation times of the labelers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s11063-021-10737-x                  | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, a large amount of training examples is often required to train &lt;em&gt;SVM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;struct&lt;/em&gt;, which can be costly for many applications that generate long and complex sequence data. This paper proposes an active learning technique to select the most informative subset of unlabeled sequences for annotation by choosing sequences that have largest uncertainty in their prediction. A unique aspect of active learning for sequence labeling is that it should take into consideration the effort spent on labeling sequences, which depends on the sequence length. A new active learning technique is proposed to use dynamic programming to identify the best subset of sequences to be annotated, taking into account both the uncertainty and labeling effort. Experiment results show that our &lt;em&gt;SVM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;struct&lt;/em&gt;active learning technique can significantly reduce the number of sequences to be labeled while outperforming other existing techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-540-70720-2_27                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A number of learning algorithms are presented and empirically evaluated on a standard data set. We show that a supervised SVM classifier using various lexical and syntactic features can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, a variety of weakly supervised learning algorithms can be applied to take advantage of large amount of unlabeled data when labeling is expensive. Newly introduced random-subspace-based algorithms demonstrate their empirical advantage over competitors in the context of both active learning and bootstrapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1016/j.is.2007.10.002                    | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The two measures for uncertainty and diversity were combined using the MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) method to give the sampling scores in our active learning strategy. We incorporated MMR-based active machine-learning idea into the biomedical named-entity recognition system. Our experimental results indicated that our strategies for active-learning based sample selection could significantly reduce the human effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning targets to minimize the human annotation efforts by selecting examples for labeling. To maximize the contribution of the selected examples, we consider the multiple criteria: informativeness, representativeness and diversity and propose measures to quantify them. More comprehensively, we incorporate all the criteria using two selection strategies, both of which result in less labeling cost than single-criterion-based method. The results of the named entity recognition in both MUC-6 and GENIA show that the labeling cost can be reduced by at least 80% without degrading the performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.3115/1218955.1219030                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

In this paper, we propose an active learning framework exploiting such relations among tasks. Intuitively, with task outputs coupled by constraints, active learning can utilize not only the uncertainty of the prediction in a single task but also the inconsistency of predictions across tasks. We formalize this idea as a cross-task value of information criteria, in which the reward of a labeling assignment is propagated and measured over all relevant tasks reachable through constraints. A specific example of our framework leads to the cross entropy measure on the predictions of coupled tasks, which generalizes the entropy in the classical single-task uncertain sampling. We conduct experiments on two real-world problems: web information extraction and document classification. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in actively collecting labeled examples for multiple related tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

One of the main problems is to label these new data for various machine learning applications correctly. The active learning approach presents a unique case of machine learning which is widely used to solve the above problem by significantly minimizing the need for labeled data. It aims to select the most appropriate samples from the unlabeled data to be correctly labeled by the oracle and is passed to train the active learner incrementally. There are several different query sampling strategies that exist using which the appropriate samples are selected. One of the main problems with the active learning approach is that it is very time-consuming. So in this research work, a new multi-core-based algorithm is proposed to speed up the active learning approach, which can utilize the complete computational resources present in the system. The experiments have been performed for the problem of named entity recognition which deals with labeling the sequences of words in an unstructured text by classifying them into pre-existing categories. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of both: the performance and execution time over three named entity recognition corpus of distinct biomedical domains. The evaluation results shows considerable improvement in terms of execution time for the proposed active learning algorithm than the existing active learning approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s00607-021-01000-1                  | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Converting static embeddings of n-grams into a dataset of interlinked concepts with explicit contextual semantic dependencies provides the foundation to acquire reusable knowledge. However, the validation of this knowledge requires cross-checking with ground-truths that may be unavailable in an actionable or computable form. This paper presents a novel approach from the new field of explainable active learning that combines methods for learning static embeddings (word2vec models) with methods for learning dynamic contextual embeddings (transformer-based BERT models). We created a dataset for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (REX) for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 dataset has 2,212 associations captured by 11 word2vec models with additional examples of use from the biomedical literature. We propose interpreting the NER and REX tasks for COVID-19 as Question Answering (QA) incorporating general medical knowledge within the question, e.g. “does ‘cough’ (n-gram) belong to ‘clinical presentation/symptoms’ for COVID-19?”. We evaluated biomedical-specific pre-trained language models (BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBERT, and PubMedBERT) versus general-domain pre-trained language models (BERT, and RoBERTa) for transfer learning with COVID-19 dataset, i.e. task-specific fine-tuning considering NER as a sequence-level task. Using 2,060 QA for training (associations from 10 word2vec models) and 152 QA for validation (associations from 1 word2vec model), BERT obtained an F-measure of 87.38%, with precision = 93.75% and recall = 81.82%. SciBERT achieved the highest F-measure of 94.34%, with precision = 98.04% and recall = 90.91%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-030-91100-3_14                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A specialty domain corpus is smaller than a general domain corpus. Moreover, annotating a specialty domain corpus is more expensive than annotating a general corpus. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a model that uses point-wise prediction and active learning to achieve a high extraction performance even in a small annotation corpus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation of active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3366030.3366072                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

First, we present work on the discovery of the language of origin of a named entity. This has applications in speech and language processing tasks, such as text-to-speech synthesis, since language of origin can help predict pronunciation of OOV words. Word origin recognition has also been studied for demographics and life sciences as a component in the collection of ethnicity data. Previous research has applied supervised machine learning methods to automate this task, but this requires a set of hand-labeled training data for each language represented in the model. Hand-labeled data may be expensive to acquire, and additionally the set of origin languages may not be known a priori. We consider how active learning can be applied to minimize the amount of annotated data needed to train a successful supervised model. We also apply word origin modeling to grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion of US surnames, using both supervised and unsupervised approaches.Finally, we present work in biomedical text mining, where we examine named entity tagging of disease mentions in biomedical text. We extract morphology information from disease terms to be included as features in a Conditional Random Field model. We also show how biomedical disease terms can be decompounded into their component stem parts. Morphology information is acquired with the Linguistica toolkit for unsupervised learning of morphology, which has the advantage that a hand-segmented training set is not required for feature extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | AAI3487647 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 1            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Most past related work on extraction of missing attribute values work with a closed world assumption with the possible set of values known beforehand, or use dictionaries of values and hand-crafted features. How can we discover new attribute values that we have never seen before? Can we do this with limited human annotation or supervision? We study this problem in the context of product catalogs that often have missing values for many attributes of interest.In this work, we leverage product profile information such as titles and descriptions to discover missing values of product attributes. We develop a novel deep tagging model OpenTag for this extraction problem with the following contributions: (1) we formalize the problem as a sequence tagging task, and propose a joint model exploiting recurrent neural networks (specifically, bidirectional LSTM) to capture context and semantics, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to enforce tagging consistency; (2) we develop a novel attention mechanism to provide interpretable explanation for our model's decisions; (3) we propose a novel sampling strategy exploring active learning to reduce the burden of human annotation. OpenTag does not use any dictionary or hand-crafted features as in prior works. Extensive experiments in real-life datasets in different domains show that OpenTag with our active learning strategy discovers new attribute values from as few as 150 annotated samples (reduction in 3.3x amount of annotation effort) with a high F-score of 83%, outperforming state-of-the-art models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/3219819.3219839                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, one does not know what is the best active learning strategy before actually testing a handful of strategies on a labeled set, which might not be viable in a real world low-resource scenario. Instead, it would be desirable to dynamically obtain the results from the best strategy on a given scenario, while using as little annotated resources as possible.In this paper, we present a novel application of prediction with expert advice to combine different query strategies as experts, giving a greater weight to those which select the most useful instances. We evaluated our approach in two Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: Part-of-Speech tagging (for English) and Named Entity Recognition (for Portuguese). Results show that our solution keeps up with the results of the best strategy in each scenario, nearly reaching fully supervised performance with only half of the annotated data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177707              | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

State-of-the-art systems heavily rely on extensively annotated corpora, which are slow to build for a new domain or task. Moreover, previous systems are mostly built with local evidence such as words in a short context window or features that are extracted at the sentence level. They usually generalize poorly on new domains. This dissertation presents novel approaches for rapidly training an IE system for a new domain or task based on both local and global evidence. Specifically, we present three systems: a relation type extension system based on active learning, a relation type extension system based on semi-supervised learning, and a cross-domain bootstrapping system for domain adaptive named entity extraction.The active learning procedure adopts features extracted at the sentence level as the local view and distributional similarities between relational phrases as the global view. It builds two classifiers based on these two views to find the most informative contention data points to request human labels so as to reduce annotation cost.The semi-supervised system aims to learn a large set of accurate patterns for extracting relations between names from only a few seed patterns. It estimates the confidence of a name pair both locally and globally: locally by looking at the patterns that connect the pair in isolation; globally by incorporating the evidence from the clusters of patterns that connect the pair. The use of pattern clusters can prevent semantic drift and contribute to a natural stopping criterion for semi-supervised relation pattern discovery.For adapting a named entity recognition system to a new domain, we propose a cross-domain bootstrapping algorithm, which iteratively learns a model for the new domain with labeled data from the original domain and unlabeled data from the new domain. We first use word clusters as global evidence to generalize features that are extracted from a local context window. We then select self-learned instances as additional training examples using multiple criteria, including some based on global evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | AAI3524194 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We introduce and compare different approaches to reduce class imbalance by design within the context of active learning (AL). Our goal is to compile more balanced data sets up front during annotation time when AL is used as a strategy to acquire training material. We situate our approach in the context of named entity recognition. Our experiments reveal that we can indeed reduce class imbalance and increase the performance of classifiers on minority classes while preserving a good overall performance in terms of macro F-score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/1597735.1597754                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This is particularly expensive to obtain for structured prediction tasks, where each training instance may have multiple, interacting labels, all of which must be correctly annotated for the instance to be of use to the learner. Traditional active learning addresses this problem by optimizing the order in which the examples are labeled to increase learning efficiency. However, this approach does not consider the difficulty of labeling each example, which can vary widely in structured prediction tasks. For example, the labeling predicted by a partially trained system may be easier to correct for some instances than for others.We propose a new active learning paradigm which reduces not only how many instances the annotator must label, but also how difficult each instance is to annotate. The system also leverages information from partially correct predictions to efficiently solicit annotations from the user. We validate this active learning framework in an interactive information extraction system, reducing the total number of annotation actions by 22%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

One type of processing appropriate for many tasks is information extraction, a type of text skimming that retrieves specific types of information from text. Although information extraction systems have existed for two decades, these systems have generally been built by hand and contain domain specific information, making them difficult to port to other domains. A few researchers have begun to apply machine learning to information extraction tasks, but most of this work has involved applying learning to pieces of a much larger system. This dissertation presents a novel rule representation specific to natural language and a relational learning system, R scAPIER, which learns information extraction rules. R scAPIER takes pairs of documents and filled templates indicating the information to be extracted and learns pattern-matching rules to extract fillers for the slots in the template. The system is tested on several domains, showing its ability to learn rules for different tasks. R scAPIER's performance is compared to a propositional learning system for information extraction, demonstrating the superiority of relational learning for some information extraction tasks.Because one difficulty in using machine learning to develop natural language processing systems is the necessity of providing annotated examples to supervised learning systems, this dissertation also describes an attempt to reduce the number of examples R scAPIER requires by employing a form of active learning. Experimental results show that the number of examples required to achieve a given level of performance can be significantly reduced by this method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | AAI9905698 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no ER task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 1          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, such development cost claims are not normally backed up by controlled studies which show that such development cost savings actually occur. This situation in Language Engineering is contrasted with Software Engineering in general, where a lot of studies investigating system development cost have been carried out. We argue for the need of controlled studies that measure actual system development time in language engineering. To this end, we carry out an experiment in resource monitoring for an IE task: three named entity taggers for the same "surprise" domain are developed in parallel, using competing methods. Their human development time is accounted forusing a logging facility.We report development cost results for parallel implementations of a named entity tagger and present a breakdown of the development time for the three alternative methods. We are not aware of detailed previous parallel studies that detail how system development time is spent when creating a named entity tagger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/1277741.1277905                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

As one example, the thousands of family history books scanned, OCRed, and placed on-line by Family-Search.org probably contain hundreds of millions of fact assertions about people, places, family relationships, and life events. Data like this cannot be fully utilized until a person or process locates the data in the document text, extracts it, and structures it with respect to an ontology or database schema. Yet, in the family history industry and other industries, data in lists goes largely unused because no known approach adequately addresses all of the costs, challenges, and requirements of a complete end-to-end solution to this task. The diverse information is costly to extract because many kinds of lists appear even within a single document, differing from each other in both structure and content. The lists' records and component data fields are usually not set apart explicitly from the rest of the text, especially in a corpus of OCRed historical documents. OCR errors and the lack of document structure (e.g. HMTL tags) make list content hard to recognize by a software tool developed without a substantial amount of highly specialized, hand-coded knowledge or machine learning supervision. Making an approach that is not only accurate but also sufficiently scalable in terms of time and space complexity to process a large corpus efficiently is especially challenging.In this dissertation, we introduce a novel family of scalable approaches to list discovery and ontology population. Its contributions include the following. We introduce the first general-purpose methods of which we are aware for both list detection and wrapper induction for lists in OCRed or other plain text. We formally outline a mapping between in-line labeled text and populated ontologies, effectively reducing the ontology population problem to a sequence labeling problem, opening the door to applying sequence labelers and other common text tools to the goal of populating a richly structured ontology from text. We provide a novel admissible heuristic for inducing regular expression wrappers using an A\* search. We introduce two ways of modeling list-structured text with a hidden Markov model. We present two query strategies for active learning in a list-wrapper induction setting. Our primary contributions are two complete and scalable wrapper-induction-based solutions to the end-to-end challenge of finding lists, extracting data, and populating an ontology. The first has linear time and space complexity and extracts highly accurate information at a low cost in terms of user involvement. The second has time and space complexity that are linear in the size of the input text and quadratic in the length of an output record and achieves higher F1-measures for extracted information as a function of supervision cost. We measure the performance of each of these approaches and show that they perform better than strong baselines, including variations of our own approaches and a conditional random field-based approach.                        | AAI28115256 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["book/dissertation"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A fine-grained named entity recognizer (NER) is an essential module for identifying opinion targets in text messages, and a named-entity (NE) dictionary is a major resource that affects the performance of an NER. However, it is not easy to construct an NE dictionary manually, because human annotation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To reduce construction time and labor, we propose a semi-automatic system to construct an NE dictionary from the free online resource, Wikipedia. The proposed system constructs a pseudo-document for each Wikipedia NE by using an active-learning technique. It then classifies Wikipedia entries into NE classes based on similarities between the entries and pseudo-documents located in a vector space. In experiments, the proposed system classified 92.3 % of Wikipedia entries into 29 NE classes. It showed a high performance, with a macro-averaging F1-measure of 0.872 and micro-averaging F1-measure of 0.935.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s11042-016-3445-8                   | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

One well-known method to gain labeled data efficiently is Active Learning (AL), where the learner interactively asks human experts to label the most informative data point. Nevertheless, even by applying AL in labeling tasks the amount of human effort is still too high and should be minimized further. In this paper therefore we propose WeakAL, which incorporates Weak Supervision (WS) techniques directly into the AL cycle. This allows us to reduce the number of annotations by human experts while keeping the same level of ML performance. We investigate different WS strategies as well as different parameter combinations for a wide range of real-world datasets. Our evaluation shows that for example in the context of Web table classification, 55% of otherwise manually retrieved labels can be generated by WS techniques with a negligible loss of test accuracy by 0.31% only. To further prove the general applicability of our approach we applied it to six datasets from the AL challenge from Guyon et al., where over 90% of the labels could be computed by the WS techniques, while still achieving competitive competition results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Export Date: 12 January 2024; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Philipp"=>"Excluded", "Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: weak supervision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 10.1007/978-3-030-61527-7_3                 | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 1           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We investigate three different stopping criteria for active learning of named entity recognition (NER) and show that one of them, gradient-based stopping, (i) reliably stops active learning, (ii) achieves nearoptimal NER performance, (iii) and needs only about 20% as much training data as exhaustive labeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

We introduce the tag posterior probability as the tag confidence measure of an individual NE tag determined by the base model. Dubious tags are automatically detected as recognition errors, and regarded as targets of manual correction. Compared to entire sentence posterior probability, tag posterior probability has the advantage of minimizing system cost by focusing on those parts of the sentence that require manual correction. Using the tag confidence measure, the first technique, known as active learning, asks the editor to assign correct NE tags only to those parts that the base model could not assign tags confidently. Active learning reduces the learning cost by 66%, compared to the conventional method. As the second technique, we propose bootstrapping NER, which semi-automatically corrects dubious tags and updates its model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

A large number of unknown word, non-word and poor grammatical sentences made up the noise in the clinical corpus. Unknown words are usually complex medical vocabularies, misspellings, acronyms and abbreviations where unknown non-words are generally the clinical patterns including scores and measures. This noise produces obstacles in the initial lexical processing step as well as subsequent semantic analysis. Furthermore, the labelled data used to build ML models is very costly to obtain because it requires intensive clinical knowledge from the annotators. And even created by experts, the training examples usually contain errors and inconsistencies due to the variations in human annotators' attentiveness. Clinical domain also suffers from the nature of the imbalanced data distribution problem. These kinds of noise are very popular and potentially affect the overall information extraction performance but they were not carefully investigated in most presented health informatics systems. This paper introduces a general clinical data mining architecture which is potential of addressing all of these challenges using: automatic proof-reading process, trainable finite state pattern recogniser, iterative model development and active learning. The reportability classifier based on this architecture achieved 98.25% sensitivity and 96.14% specificity on an Australian cancer registry's held-out test set and up to 92% of training data provided for supervised ML was saved by active learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1145/2939672.2939720                     | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Over the past decade, a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars, extracting some predefined named entities, extracting users' intents for call classification, to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper, we present the SLU system of VoiceTone® (a service provided by AT&amp;T where AT&amp;T develops, deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination, we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data, and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance; 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data; and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes. We present an evaluation of this system using two deployed applications of VoiceTone®.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

This is often at the cost of lengthy wait-times for the user between each query iteration. We deal with a real-world information extraction task, extracting attribute-value pairs from product descriptions, where the learning system needs to be interactive and the user's time needs to be used efficiently. The first step uses coEM with naive Bayes as the semi-supervised algorithm. This paper focuses on the second step which is an interactive active learning phase. We present an approximation to coEM with naive Bayes that can incorporate user feedback almost instantly and can use any sample-selection strategy for active learning. Our experimental results show high levels of accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster than using the standard coEM with naive Bayes, making our IE system practical by optimizing user time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-540-74958-5_68                | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

More specifically, the domain-specific problems are: (1) success prediction in crowdfunding, (2) variants identification in biomedical literature, and (3) text data augmentation for domains with low-resources.In the first part, transfer learning in a multimodal perspective is utilized to facilitate solving the project success prediction on the crowdfunding application. Even though the information in a project profile can be of different modalities such as text, images, and metadata, most existing prediction approaches leverage only the text modality. It is promising to utilize the visual images in project profiles to find out how images could contribute to the success prediction. An advanced neural network scheme is designed and evaluated combining information learned from different modalities for project success prediction.In the second part, transfer learning is combined with deep learning techniques to solve genomic variants Named Entity Recognition (NER) problems in biomedical literature. Most of the advanced generic NER algorithms can fail due to the restricted training corpus. However, those generic deep learning algorithms are capable of learning from a canonical corpus, without any effort on feature engineering. This work aims to build an end-to-end deep learning approach to transfer the domain-specific knowledge to those advanced generic NER algorithms, addressing the challenges in low-resource training and requiring neither hand-crafted features nor post-processing rules.For the last part, transfer learning with knowledge distillation and active learning are utilized to solve text augmentation for domains with low-resources. Most of the recent text augmentation methods heavily rely on large external resources. This work is dedicates to solving the text augmentation problem adaptively and consistently with minimal resources for token-level tasks like NER. The solution can also assure the reliability of machine labels for noisy data and can enhance training consistency with noisy labels.All the work are evaluated on different domain-specific benchmarks, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of those methods. The advantages also indicate promising potential for transfer learning in domain-specific applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | AAI27961717 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: AL not applied to ER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 1                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Active learning has been proven to be effective in reducing manual annotation efforts for supervised learning tasks where a human judge is asked to annotate the most informative examples with respect to a given model. However, in most cases reliable human judges are not available for all languages. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual unsupervised active learning paradigm (XLADA) that generates high-quality automatically annotated training data from a word-aligned parallel corpus. To evaluate our paradigm, we applied XLADA on English-French and English-Chinese bilingual corpora then we trained French and Chinese information extraction models. The experimental results show that XLADA can produce effective models without manually-annotated training data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/978-3-319-11656-3_3                 | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

However, they exhibit several weaknesses in practice, including (a) inability to use uncertainty sampling with black-box models, (b) lack of robustness to labeling noise, and (c) lack of transparency. In response, we propose a transparent batch active sampling framework by estimating the error decay curves of multiple feature-defined subsets of the data. Experiments on four named entity recognition (NER) tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform diversification-based methods for black-box NER taggers, and can make the sampling process more robust to labeling noise when combined with uncertainty-based methods. Furthermore, the analysis of experimental results sheds light on the weaknesses of different active sampling strategies, and when traditional uncertainty-based or diversification-based methods can be expected to work well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10.1007/s10994-020-05897-1                  | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

The proposed method is based on the classifiers such as Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and has been tested for Bengali. The system makes use of the language independent features in the form of different contextual and orthographic word level features along with the language dependent features extracted from the Part of Speech (POS) tagger and gazetteers. Context patterns generated from the unlabeled data using an active learning method have been used as the features in each of the classifiers. A semi-supervised method has been used to describe the measures to automatically select effective documents and sentences from unlabeled data. Finally, the models have been combined together into a final system by weighted voting technique. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the overall Recall, Precision, and F-Score values of 93.81%, 92.18% and 92.98%, respectively. We have shown how the language dependent features can improve the system performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Excluded"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                             | 1         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |

Specifically, a plug-in architecture has been developed which allows components to be added to WordFreak for customized visualization, annotation specification, and automatic annotation, without re-compilation. The APIs for these plug-ins provide mechanisms to allow automatic annotators or taggers to guide future annotation to supports active learning.

This can result in a missed cluster effect, which signficantly lowers recall and slows down learning for infrequent classes. We show that missed clusters can be avoided in sequence classification tasks by using sentences as natural multi-instance units for labeling. Co-selection of other tokens within sentences provides an implicit exploratory component since we found for the task of named entity recognition on two corpora that entity classes co-occur with sufficient frequency within sentences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {"Yoka"=>"Included"} | USER-NOTES: {"Yoka"=>["Done"]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                             | 0         | 0                     | 0          | 0                 | 0     | 0            | 0                 | 0       | 0               | 0           | 0                  | 0                  | 0             | 0               | 0               | 0             | 0     |
